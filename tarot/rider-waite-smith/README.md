# Rider-Waite-Smith Tarot

## Description

The Rider-Waite-Smith (also known as Rider-Waite or Waite-Smith) tarot deck is one of the most popular and influential tarot decks in the world. Originally published in 1909 by the Rider Company, it was conceived by Arthur Edward Waite, a prominent member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, and illustrated by Pamela Colman Smith.

This deck revolutionized tarot by including detailed illustrative scenes on all 78 cards, including the Minor Arcana, making it more accessible for intuitive reading. The symbolism draws from various mystical traditions including Kabbalah, astrology, alchemy, and Christian mysticism.
