## About I Ching

The I Ching, or Book of Changes, is an ancient Chinese divination text and one of the oldest of the Chinese classics. It uses a system of 64 hexagrams, each composed of six lines (either broken or unbroken), to provide guidance and wisdom.

## Structure

Each I Ching tradition should be in its own subdirectory:

```
iching/
├── wilhelm-baynes/      # Richard Wilhelm translation
├── traditional/         # Traditional Chinese interpretation
└── ...
```

Community contributions are welcome to add I Ching interpretations:
- Create a subdirectory for your tradition/translation
- Add `grammar.json` with hexagram definitions
- Add `LICENSE` with appropriate license information
- Add `README.md` with description and attribution chain

Please ensure proper attribution and use an appropriate open license when contributing.
