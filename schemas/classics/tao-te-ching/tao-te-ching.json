  "description": "The Tao Te Ching (道德經), attributed to Laozi, is a foundational text of Taoist philosophy. This schema presents both James Legge's English translation (1891) and the original Chinese text. Note: The Legge translation, while historically significant, reflects 19th-century colonial and Christian interpretive frameworks that may not fully honor the original Taoist context. It is included here because it is in the public domain—a starting point for the recursive.eco community to build upon with more accurate, culturally-sensitive translations.",
