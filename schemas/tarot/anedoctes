        "Interpretation": "The unnumbered trump is known as the Fool. It depicts a jester, a lunatic, or a naïve and disheveled wanderer. \"Bridges and Balloons,\" with its storybook travelogue, captures this same innocence. Depending on who you ask, the song's tone can be taken as a healthy sense of childlike wonder, or as condemnable childishness.\n\nOur traveler carries a model ship, and wears a dress decorated with pictures of the four Aces floating above a fantastical sea voyage. They have experienced the wider world through stories and games, but have yet to see it firsthand. The balloons in the distance bear symbols from the final sequence of trumps, anticipating the journey ahead.\n\nIt is a bright and cold winter morning, the pale blue sky glowing against the rich brown earth. In their outfit of bright primary colors, the Fool stands out sharply from the landscape. But just as the primary colors can blend to any shade, we hope that the Fool can transform to meet the occasion.\n\nWithout a set number, this card is a wanderer who can fit in anywhere. Their fate is undecided, but that detail, like the open door of their bird-cage, seems not to worry them.",

        "Interpretation": "The trumps traditionally begin with a Juggler, a street performer or mountebank. Whatever tools they carry, this is a tricky character who lives by their wits and eloquence. Hourglass in hand, our Nightjar-Juggler bends time into a lemniscate – the shape of infinity. With their binoculars, they can discern what is far away, and see without being seen. Smiling, they perform a disappearing-appearing act. Like the birds they blend into the winter leaves, or they are miraculously born into open air.\n\nThe three birds surrounding the Juggler are recurring characters on the album Divers. In the song, they are united in some covert operation. They are enveloped in the warm grays of a misty winter day, where those of us less discerning than these scouts can easily become lost. The picture is meant to evoke the feeling of hearing a birdcall without being able to discern its source, the feeling of being tricked – pleasantly, but tricked all the same. If this card occurs in a reading, one must determine whether the querent is using the cleverness of the Juggler themselves, or taken into one of the Juggler's illusions.\n\nJust as the hidden provenance of \"Anecdotes\" is revealed at the end of Divers, the rest of the trumps will arrange themselves to show the elusive Juggler's place in the cycle.",

        "Interpretation": "From the airy place beyond the dawn, we travel toward sunset and sea. Trump II introduces duality: dawn and dusk, birth and death, the divers and the sailors, and the women on the pier.\n\nIn the Tarot de Marseille, II is the Papess, counterpart to V. In this deck, their titles are changed, but their kinship remains. Both bridge two worlds: here, the worlds are land and sea. Where V teaches, II tends to guard her secrets, like the pearl that she holds by her feet.\n\nThis card represents gestation. Popular lore tells us that all life emerged from the sea, and in the creation story of Genesis the landscape before the Earth is formed consists only of the waters. The ocean is the place where things reside before they choose their form. II is immersed in this source. Her skin is colorless like a creature of a submerged cave, and the coral on her dress branches like primitive veins.\n\nThe Female Pope is widely believed to depict the legendary Pope Joan, who rose to the papacy by impersonating a man, but finally exposed herself through pregnancy. When her sex was revealed, she was executed for overstepping a woman's place. \"Divers,\" while not about the Catholic church, speaks of similar binding rules. While men are allowed to explore the oceans and hunt for treasure there, women must wait for them on land. In this context, the calm of II can appear deathly, like a submission to this restrictive order. The golden ropes crossing on her chest tie her back, like a yoke. Yet while she is physically bound to the pier, her thoughts can move across the water. She weighs these dualities and looks to the place where they rejoin – the heart in the center of the shell.",

        "Interpretation": "The third trump is traditionally the Empress, counterpart to IV. The Book of Right-On. But this is no appointed Empress – she claims her secluded plot of land by herself, and renews her right to it with the work she puts into it.\n\nThe scene reflects the song's themes of innocence and compassion. The burning heart which grows from the dirt in the palm of her hand is a common symbol of Charity, as is the stork, which is said to feed her children with her own blood in hard times. The snake, while an antagonist in the Garden of Eden, is also a symbol of wisdom, and coils around her tiller to make it into a ruler's scepter. Behind her, two vines twine around a tree. One is friendly and leafy while the other is barren and thorny, but both are equally supported and nourished.\n\nSpecifically in Christian symbolism, both stork and fish have been used to represent Jesus' sacrifice. The fish is also symbolic of the goddess Venus, through her birth at sea as well as through the origin of the constellation Pisces. Her crown is made of two golden ears of corn, tying her to XIII. Cosmia and XXI. Time, As a Symptom, and the solar symbols on the hems of her dress link her with IV.\n\nWhether an archetypal mother figure or the young founder of a new empire, III provides a gentle atmosphere in which to grow.",

The motifs on his clothing and table refer to the Sun, and this solar energy comes with both clarity and austerity.\n\nThe number four signifies stability and foundations, as in the four cardinal directions, the four classical elements, or the four legs of a table. IV is the card of law and order. As it is written in his book, so it goes in the world. The eight-spoked wheel of his glowing scepter references the wheel of XIV. No Provenance. His cloak has a four-colored rainbow, and the heptagram on his boot is a reminder of the Chaldean order of the planets, from which we derive the days of the week. He is crowned with a laurel wreath of victory, and like his dogs he is at ease but ready to fight if the need arises.\n\nThis card walks the line between confidence and arrogance. The question to work out is whether his strength is protection, or domination.",

        "Interpretation": "The fifth trump is traditionally The Pope. Though the song \"Emily\" does fit the bill with its Biblical references, this depiction is modeled not after a pope, but after Renaissance personifications of Astrology or Astronomy. The Pontiff acts as a bridge between heaven and earth, and interprets celestial mysteries for the people of the Church. An astronomer fills a similar role in the secular world.\n\nIn the sky are two of the asterisms mentioned in the song, the Big Dipper and the Pleiades. The astrolabe's rule points to the months when they are at their most visible in the Northern Hemisphere. The Pope uses the two keys of St. Peter to represent his power on heaven and on earth. This symbol is converted here to the reflections of the stars and skipping stones – what is done on earth is done also in heaven, and observed.\n\nThe counterpart of V is II. Divers, both conduits for spiritual power. The ledger in this card represents the more systematic and educational approach that sets V apart from II. As well as a researcher, V is a carrier of tradition, passing it on to the following generations. Thus, this card can signify both new discovery and heritage, truths that continue to renew themselves.",

The mother and child are at the center, but the love and loyalty represented by the bulldog is not limited to blood kinship. The song \"Esme\" encompasses all changing human relationships.\n\nThe thorns of the blackberry and the blood drops on the mother's gown are reminders of pain and sacrifice, but the overall effect is wonder, at the mother emerging from Earth and the child from Air. Ties and rails fall into line bearing kindness. While some force or machine must be there to build the railroad, the only concern in this card is to be carried along, grateful for the protection and the generosity: the guardian bear of the boat and the ghostly hand that holds the kite-string.",

Anecdotes. Both birds' calls can serve as markers of time. Both also make distinctive, alarming noises with their wings, the nightjar while diving and the dove while ascending, as one can imagine them doing in this picture.\n\nThe tetrad rainbow, which binds the figurehead to the ship, links to IV. The Book of Right-On and the imperial dream of colonizing both Space and Time, which by the end of the song turns into an unstoppable nightmare.\n\nThis card does have a positive side. Traveling light is a marvelous spectacle, and this ship lets one see from an entirely new perspective. Before you board, make sure you know who's behind the wheel.",

Her feet point to the East and she is ready to go somewhere new. This feeling echoes the migrating geese in their V outside the window.\n\nThe heart in the scales rises, no longer heavy as an oil drum – but she may be manipulating the scales with her legs. How much of Justice is letting things take their natural course, and how much is making a conscious choice?\n\nThe challenge of this card is to honestly take stock of one's life (along with one's jewelry and pretty dresses).

The waning crescents on the hem of their dress represent the decline at the end of this decade, while the lemniscates recall eternity and neverending lawlessness. As in other cards, the number seven is used as an indication of time. The seven mushrooms are Amanitas, a genus often symbiotic with pines, which contains some of the best known deadly and psychoactive mushrooms.\n\nAccustomed to solitude, this character is on the defensive. The peace of hermitage has been disturbed by the unknown in the form of the black bear, who lurks just outside the lantern's light. Thus, this card is not about the stasis of the sanctuary, but a moment of disruption and potential crisis. IX sits in the liminal space of not-quite-night-not-quite-morning, but time will quickly change that.",

        "Interpretation": "At the end of the first decade – the midpoint of the parade of trumps – comes the Wheel of Fortune. This version swaps the popular allegorical Wheel for a circular depiction of the geocentric universe inspired by the \"Prima Causa\" of the Mantegna Tarocchi. Around the Earth are the orbits of the seven classical planets, surrounded by the realm of the fixed stars, and within another ring of light. The Washington Monument, a centerpiece of the song, rises above the desert.\n\nThree pairs on the ground illustrate the layers that build up through the passage of time. The leftmost is from Titian's ill-regarded painting \"Tobias and the Angel.\" The middle is the mother and child uncovered beneath that work, which suddenly gave it interest. The third is meant to be a layer deeper, an underpainting.\n\nIn contrast to VI. Esme which depicts convergence, this card shows different paths diverging from a central source, one piece or land or one painted panel. As Time obscures or destroys, it clears space for new monuments built on the bones of the old. In the same way, X clears the stage for the next decade of trumps.",

        "Interpretation": "The last Cardinal Virtue in the tarot is Temperance. This is the ability of humans to control their animal nature, represented as a bridle for the mysterious little horse. The ball and block beneath the woman's feet are borrowed from Etteilla imagery. The foot on the block is stable and gives motion to the spinning wheel, while the foot on the ball holds steady only through constant movement. One must practice Temperance continually – halting or rushing results in uneven and lumpy spinning.\n\nThe apple motif refers to Johnny Appleseed, who is mentioned at the end of the song. He is an icon of conservation and well known for an ascetic Christian lifestyle. However, he has also been criticized for spreading invasive species. He sows seeds indiscriminately and leaves them behind, as we can see from the sprouts poking through the tall grass. Thus, he can be taken as either a representation of Temperance, or of its opposite.\n\nSome occult readings see Temperance, rather than a virtue, as transmutation or alchemy. This could be reflected in the picture too, as straw turns into gold.\n\nThe song refers also to the Big Return, the idea that our lives loop infinitely in a cycle with no source, only recursion. The narrator regrets the blindness that each new recursion brings, which dooms one to repeat all previous mistakes. In this light, Temperance can be read as a path to self-improvement, hoping to spin the wheel in a new direction.",

On his back he has a picture of Bear in captivity, as a reminder of his selfishness.\n\nSimilar to many artistic depictions of the Devil, Monkey \"apes\" the shape of a human. In the song, his hand as opposed to Bear's paw is used as a mark of superiority. Where V. Emily is a bridge between terrestrial and celestial, XV is a bridge between human and bestial.\n\nStill, manipulation can have a nonnegative sense – the five fingers of a hand (or a Monkey's foot) are a marker of developed skill.

The blood which spirals serpent-like from the evicted woman pools in the heart of the Earth, feeding both the carnivorous lion and the peaceful kingfisher.\n\nThe constellation Pisces drawn at the bottom of the picture, besides being Fish for the kingfisher, echoes the same theme of being bound through time. According to one origin story, Venus and Cupid transformed into fish to escape the monster Typhon, and tied themselves together so as not to lose each other in the rushing waters of the Euphrates.\n\nThis is the most ominous of the cards.

Like the three Fates, they spin out the double-twisted thread of life. The highest holds a shining seed-like golden ring, and wears an upward-facing crescent to represent receptivity and increase. The triplet one branch lower holds a sprout and wears a full-moon symbol for the wholeness of life. The one who stands in the stream abandons the sprout to the current, and wears a downward-facing crescent to represent decrease and letting go.\n\nThe leaves of the trees are changing to red and brown, their colors reflected in the flying dew drops. Like IX. Soft As Chalk, this card is at a turning point, this time between seasons rather than night and day. The question has changed from Who is there? To Should we go outside?, an invitation rather than a challenge. The Sun dissolves shadows, bringing to light both triumphs and failures.",

Against her wishes, the narrator must choose one path to go down, cutting all others off.\n\nThe area between the two birches is filled with night, trapping the figures in a dream. The woman is dressed in all flesh tones, reflecting vulnerability and a feeling of nakedness. The knife poised to skin the captured rabbit is also pointed at the woman's own heart. Meanwhile, the goose above is the epitome of the protective mother. The volume of her call clears out the landscape, beating against the woman's hesitation and uncertainty. The sky-colored egg on the ground is a token of hidden possibilities to be hatched.\n\nThe violence of the song's climax is shocking. However, the sacrifice of innumerable possible futures is necessary to move forward in one. When this card appears, it is a prompt to choose.",

In the tarot deck, XXI ends the trump sequence and starts a new, uncharted decade.\n\nThe central figure holds an ear of corn and a sickle. These are emblems of the god Cronus or Saturn, patron of time and the harvest. They are enclosed in a mandorla-shaped wreath, and bound within this wreath are the hourglass of I. Anecdotes and the pearl or egg of II. Divers.\n\nThe song alludes to the Eleusinian Mysteries, a festival commemorating Demeter's search for her daughter, the Maiden. The earth goddess' desperate journey was the origin of Earth's seasons. Though not much is known of the Mysteries, their culmination was the reaping of an ear of grain.\n\nDuring Demeter's search, she was raped by the sea god Poseidon. The figures at the bottom of the picture are two children of this union. Her son Areion had the form of a speaking horse. Her daughter is known only as the Mistress, and was venerated herself as an Earth goddess.\n\nAt the top of the picture are a White Star and a Nightjar, those called upon to transcend Time and link to the end to a new beginning.\n\nThe culmination of the trumps shows the fullness of the cycle of time, in harmony and permanence. We sow and we reap, again, and recommence the parade.",

As pip cards are generally subordinate to the trumps, this one is more focused on the physical action. It is reflecting on what to leave behind, and what to carry away. In this final stage of the suit, we let go of the places and things to which we were once bound. The coins gain space in their middles to become rings. The geometric designs inside the ribbons' loops are a simplified version of the album cover, and by giving one last tug on the ends, everything closes up and disappears from view.",

We have set borders between life and death, between past and future, between ourselves and others. The crisis of Swords comes in the title track \"Divers,\" with the dissolution of these borders. This image is inspired by both the Smith-Waite Ten of Swords and the Sola Busca Five of Coins. Though winged, the character is thrown to the ground. Their single blue sword is outnumbered by the fading pink rays, and they confront the pearl of death as mortality defeats their ideals. This card represents vanquished expectations, works undone, and feeling defeated by a problem or a puzzle.\n\nThis card links to the mental crossroads of the Two of Swords.",

        "Interpretation": "Cherry blossoms, broken by the rain, are a symbol of ephemeral beauty. The blossoms, all spring and youth, contrast with the dead spiders hanging just below. This is a reminder of the hundreds of small crimes committed daily, the seemingly inconsequential creatures that die to sustain the world. The line comes with the refrain be a woman. The illusory ideal of femininity is as fragile as the blossoms, and like them is underpinned by thousands of harms. At its most negative, this card signifies a slow, but unstoppable, draining.\n\nThis card echoes the call to a sister that began in the Three of Cups.",

The image can be interpreted with a typical water-as-emotion metaphor, as feeling overwhelmed with dread building like a looming wave. The familiar sanctuary of the animals' pen transforms into a foreign scene of terror and anxiety.\n\nIn this card, the vision below the surface in the Two of Cups moves into the waking world.",
