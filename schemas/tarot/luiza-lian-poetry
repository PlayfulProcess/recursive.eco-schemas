Each card holds a song—Portuguese lyrics, personal imagery, and poetic translations in animist Yoruba English that honor the orixás, the ancestors, and the living spirit in all things.\n\nHow to use: Draw a card. Open Spotify and let the song play on repeat. Read the Portuguese slowly, feeling the sounds. Move through the personal images. Let the Yoruba English translation open another doorway. Sit with what arrives.\n\nThe music carries axé—the life force that moves through all things. These are not translations but transmissions. Let them move you.",
