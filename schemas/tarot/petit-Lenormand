  "description": "A 34-card Lenormand oracle deck with playful artistic interpretations of the traditional symbols.\n\nThe Lenormand system, named after the famous French fortune-teller Marie Anne Lenormand (1772-1843), uses a 36-card deck with straightforward symbolic imagery. Unlike tarot, Lenormand cards are typically read in combinations where meanings blend together.\n\nThis version includes some creative variations: Goose (instead of Stork), Rabbits (instead of Mice), and Dove (instead of Lily). Note: This edition omits cards 8 (Coffin) and 9 (Bouquet).\n\nArtwork by Yve Lepkowski (https://stolen-thyme.com/).
