  "description": "The Grand Etteilla, also known as the Tarot Egyptien, was created by Jean-Baptiste Alliette (1738-1791), who reversed his name to create his pseudonym 'Etteilla'. This was one of the first tarot decks designed specifically for divination rather than card games. Images from https://benebellwen.com/etteilla/downloads/. \n\nThe deck follows a unique ordering based on the story of Creation: Chaos, Light, Plants, Heavens, Man and Animals, Stars, Birds and Fishes, Rest. The meanings here are adapted for reflective, non-predictive readings with a focus on self-understanding.",
