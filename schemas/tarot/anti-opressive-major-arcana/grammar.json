  "description": "An analeptic exploration of social working—not social work (the profession), but the verb: what communities, spirits, elements, and all beings have always done. Closing analysis in 'social work as profession' is already colonizing. Decolonizing means putting social work in a social working perspective. L4 'Social Working' contains: L3 'The Violent History' (Chapman & Withers' 40 names from professional social work); L3 'The Partnership Way' (Eisler's insight that the opposite of patriarchy isn't matriarchy but partnership—where ROLES survive, not names); L3 'Wicked History' (cultural memory that dwarfs the standard account—Jane Addams is a flat line on Google Trends while Wicked explodes); L3 'The Rest of the Worlds' (more-than-human social working: kingdoms, elements, epistemologies). All figures are complicit. The mainstream has never run clean.",
