  "description": "A 55-card tarot deck examining interlocking oppressions in social work history. Phase 1: Initial 40 figures extracted from Chapman & Withers' 'A Violent History of Benevolence' (2019), Chapter 1: 'Troubling the Standard Account of Social Work'—producing figures from both the 'standard account' (Jane Addams, Mary Richmond) and those erased from it (Ida B. Wells, Claudette Colvin). Phase 2: Recognizing the source text's limitations in addressing Indigenous perspectives and non-Western community care, the deck was expanded with contemporary decolonial voices (Bayo Akomolafe, Vanessa Andreotti, Josh Shrei) and 'The Cracks' (The Grandmother, Preto Velho, The Doula). Phase 3: Organized into four suits with archetypal resonances rather than 1-1 Major Arcana mapping. All figures are complicit. As Bayo Akomolafe says: 'There are always cracks in the systems.'",
