# Social Working: An Analeptic Deck

An analeptic exploration of **social working**—not social work (the profession), but the verb: what communities, spirits, elements, and all beings have always done.

## The Core Insight

**Closing analysis in "social work as profession" is already colonizing.** Decolonizing means putting social work in a social working perspective.

This deck is built on three insights:

1. **Chapman & Withers**: "The mainstream has never run clean, perhaps never can."
2. **Riane Eisler**: The opposite of patriarchy isn't matriarchy—it's partnership. In partnership societies, ROLES survived, not names.
3. **Google Trends**: Jane Addams (the "founder" of social work) is a flat line. MLK spikes annually. Wicked explodes in 2024. The "standard account" barely registers in cultural memory.

## The Four L3 Worlds

### 1. The Violent History (Chapman & Withers)
The 40 names extracted from *A Violent History of Benevolence* (2019). Professional social work history—the Standard Account and those Erased from it. All figures are complicit.

### 2. The Partnership Way (Eisler)
From *The Chalice and the Blade* (1987): the opposite of patriarchy isn't matriarchy—it's partnership (gylany). In partnership societies, individual names didn't survive—only **ROLES**. The Grandmother, not Jane Addams. Preto Velho (the enslaved elder), not a named person.

### 3. Wicked History (Cultural Memory)
The Oz-to-Wiz-to-Wicked arc:
- **Wizard of Oz** (1900/1939): The canonical story. White Kansas girl's journey. Also: written by a man who called for Native genocide.
- **The Wiz** (1975/1978): Black cultural reimagining. Kansas becomes Harlem. 7 Tony Awards. Then the composer dies forgotten.
- **Wicked** (1995/2003): The villain's perspective. Elphaba wasn't wicked—she was different, fighting oppression, painted monstrous by those in power.

Google Trends proves the point: the "standard account" of social work barely registers while Wicked explodes.

### 4. The Rest of the Worlds (More-than-Human)
Social working predates humans. The Kingdoms (Animal, Plant, Mineral, Fungi), The Elements (Water, Fire, Air, Earth), Non-Duality (Spirit/Matter), Epistemologies (Science/Religion). What would it mean to learn social working from fungi?

## Core Principles

### All figures are complicit
This project does not divide figures into "good" vs "bad." Everyone named—whether celebrated founders, erased resisters, or cultural icons—participated in interlocking systems. The deck invites reflection on complicity rather than identification with innocence.

### Analeptic thinking
From Chapman & Withers: "a persistent dredging operation" of history. Holding contradictions without resolving them. The mainstream has never run clean, perhaps never can.

### Roles, not names
Eisler's insight: in partnership societies, what survived was roles—the Grandmother, the Doula—not individual names. This is how decolonial social working might look.

## Sources

### Primary Sources
- **Chapman, C., & Withers, A. J. (2019).** *A Violent History of Benevolence.* University of Toronto Press.
- **Eisler, R. (1987).** *The Chalice and the Blade: Our History, Our Future.* Harper & Row.
- **Maguire, G. (1995).** *Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West.* ReganBooks.

### Theoretical Framework
- Spivak, G. C. on "persistent dredging operations" and complicity
- Ahmed, S. on how racism shapes surfaces of bodies and worlds
- Akomolafe, B. on "slowing down" and "cracks in the systems"
- Andreotti, V. on "hospicing modernity"

## Use of AI in This Project

This project was developed collaboratively with **Claude** (Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.5) using **Claude Code**.

### What AI contributed:
- Systematic extraction of names from source text
- JSON schema structuring and validation
- Documentation and README creation
- Git workflow management

### What remains human:
- Conceptual framework and critical analysis
- The analeptic framing (social working vs social work)
- Source material selection and interpretation
- Ethical judgments about representation

### Transparency
All AI-assisted work is tracked through git commits with session links. The use of AI is itself a point of reflection: AI systems are trained on data reflecting existing visibility biases—the very biases this project inverts.
