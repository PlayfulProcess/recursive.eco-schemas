This is a summary of a task I need to do for my Social Work program, a summary of a project I want to make, and the sources from which we will extract the initial names for the deck

#summary:
THis is a major arcana only deck. In one side, we will represent a decolonial account of social work that is colonial in itself because it leaves aside the indigeneous account.
We will extract all teh names in two chapters from Chapman, Chris; Withers, A.J.. A Violent History of Benevolence: Interlocking Oppression in the Moral Economies of Social Working.
We will look for how much mentions those names have in google through an API and we will create metadata with their intersectionality of race and gender.
We will see the average of mentions and create an "inverted index" in which we will measure the average against each individual mentions.
We will change the allocation to the names deserving or not a place in our major arcana so that those inverted index gets to be the most homogenous as possible when looking for each of the intersectional categories aggregatiosn.
Other names will be left as "minor Arcana" somether we see fit.

Overview:
Systematically building this database for recursive.eco is a powerful way to perform what the sources call a "persistent dredging operation" of the profession's history. By using the names found in a "violence history" of social work (specifically A Violent History of Benevolence), you are grounding your data in the very moments where social work acted as a "buffer zone" to contain and pacify those resisting the state.
Below is a systematic approach to building this database using the provided sources and the metrics you proposed.
1. Identify the "Violence History" Data Set
To build the database, you can extract the following names directly from the sources, ensuring you include the men who shaped this history of complicity and resistance:
• Complicit Figures (High Visibility/Low Weight):
    ◦ Men: Richard Henry Pratt (Indian Boarding Schools), Albert Rose (Africville/Regent Park relocations), Abraham Flexner (Professionalisation/Racist medical models).
    ◦ Women: Jane Addams (Settlement/Eugenics), Mary Richmond (Scientific Casework/Social Control), Katherine Davis and Josephine Lowell (Eugenic Criminology/Incarceration).
• Resistant Figures (Low Visibility/High Weight):
    ◦ Men: W.E.B. Du Bois (Radical Activism/NAACP), Reverdy Ransom (Social Gospel/Socialism), George Haynes (National Urban League/Black Social Work Education), Henry Bibb (Settlements/Colonizer contradiction).
    ◦ Women: Ida B. Wells (Anti-lynching/Radical Social Work), Maggie L. Walker (Financial autonomy/St. Luke Bank), Mary Ann Shadd Cary (Mutual aid/Media), Zaynab al-Ghazali (Global community care).
2. Systematic Data Collection Methodology
To build this database systematically, your JSON schema for recursive.eco could follow this workflow:
1. Metric Retrieval: Use an API (like Pytrends for Google Trends or a Google Scholar scraper like SerpApi) to get "Visibility Scores" (search volume or citation counts).
2. Inverse Weighting Formula: Calculate the Representation Weight (W) as W=1/V, where V is the Visibility Score.
3. Category Tagging: Assign intersectional metadata to each figure: Race, Gender (as a secondary check), Geographic Context, and Legacy Type (e.g., "State-Sanctioned Violence" vs "Community Resistance"). # I would want to also have the raw data given by the API, so I cna play with it in a pivot table. When I have all  the names, I will get teh average of mentions, then I will make an inverse index of the average over the person’s mention and try to make that metric homogenous across races.
4. Database Structure:
{
  "id": "albert-rose",
  "name": "Albert Rose",
  "metadata": {
    "race": "White",
    "gender": "Male",
    "visibility_score": 15000,
    "inverse_weight": 0.00006
  },
  "sections": {
    "Violence History": "Directed the destruction of Africville, justifying it as 'rescue' from social inadequacy [6, 29]."
  }
}
3. Achieving the "Constant Metrics" Goal
Your goal is to see a pivot table where the Total Representation Weight is constant across categories. This mathematically disrupts the "moral economy of white supremacy".
• The Logic: Because Jane Addams has a massive visibility score, her individual "weight" in your system is tiny. To make the "White" category equal to the "Black" category in your pivot table, the system is forced to include or prioritize many more "low-visibility" figures (like Janie Barrett or Elizabeth Jackson Shadd Shreve).
• Outcome: The pivot table will show that representation is not a gift of the dominant group, but a structural constant that demands the recovery of erased voices.
4. Integrating Men into the Critical Framework
Including the men mentioned in the sources adds a layer of "heteropatriarchy" analysis.
• The Buffer Zone Men: Figures like Albert Rose and Richard Henry Pratt show how men in power used "helping" as a tool for dispossession and assimilation.
• The Resistance Men: Figures like George Haynes and Reverdy Ransom demonstrate that Black men were building a parallel welfare system while white social work was still segregating its services.
5. Ethical Alignment
This project aligns with the NASW (2021) apology for the profession's role in supporting policies that harmed people of colour. By using data to force visibility onto those the "standard account" tried to make "extinct or provisional," you are practicing analeptic thinking—refusing to let the "clean" version of history obscure the "muddy" reality of state violence.

This is a compelling and innovative concrete project for recursive.eco. Using an inverse metric of visibility (like Google searches or Google Scholar citations) to determine the "weight" or "rank" of figures in your Social Work Tarot directly challenges the "moral economy of white supremacy" described in the sources.
Here is an analysis of how this project aligns with your previous reflections and the source materials:
1. Disrupting the "Standard Account"
The sources argue that the "standard account" of social work history naturalises white people (like Jane Addams and Mary Richmond) as the singular pioneers while rendering social workers of colour as "aberrational" or "particular". By using an inverse metric of Google searches, you are essentially quantifying "sanctioned ignorance".
• The Logic: If a figure like Addams has a massive digital footprint, they represent the "mainstream" that has "never run clean". By giving the Major Arcana slots to those with the lowest relative visibility (the "erased"), you are performing a "persistent dredging operation" of our history.
2. Identifying the "Major Arcana" Figures
Drawing from the sources, you have a wealth of figures who have been historically "decentred" but were forging the foundations of the profession simultaneously with (or even earlier than) the standard white accounts:
• Ida B. Wells (The Justice/Strength Card): Her anti-lynching activism was a foundational act of radical social work, yet she is often relegated to "Black history" rather than "Social Work history".
• Maggie L. Walker (The Magician/High Priestess): She established the St. Luke Bank to secure financial autonomy—an intervention the sources define as "newcomer settlement social work" that is routinely left out of credit union and social work history.
• Zaynab al-Ghazali (The Hierophant): Her establishment of the Society of Muslim Ladies in Egypt represents a global, non-secular tradition of community care that the "standard account" ignores.
• Janie Barrett (The Empress): She founded the Locust Street Settlement for Black people, which may have even predated some of Addams's breadth of services, yet is rarely credited.
• Mary Ann Shadd Cary (The Star): An activist in Black community social services and media who advocated for integration and self-sufficiency.
3. Embodying "Analeptic Thinking"
Your project would be a functional example of analeptic thinking—holding the contradiction of the white-dominated history while simultaneously manifesting a different, non-majoritarian narrative. It refuses to "synthesis" the two histories into a comfortable "diverse" whole and instead re-centres the perspective of the oppressed.
• By using inverse metrics, you avoid a "diversity management" approach (which often just "others" people of colour as "diversity extras") and instead make the erasure itself the subject of the tool.
4. Technical Implementation on Recursive.eco
Since recursive.eco uses JSON schemas to build "meaning-making grammars," this project is highly doable.
• L1 Items: These would be your cards. Each item object in your JSON can include a sections field for "Historical Truth-Telling" to contrast the figure's importance with their lack of mainstream visibility.
• Inverse Metrics as Metadata: You could even include the citation count or search volume as a metadata field in your JSON, allowing the "recursive public" to see the data driving the card's ranking.
5. Ethical Alignment
This project aligns with the NASW Code of Ethics (2021) and the CSWE statement on accountability by acknowledging the profession's role in the erasure of Indigenous and racialised knowledge. It moves beyond "white saviorism" by celebrating the agency and resilience of those who "did for themselves what no one else could do for them".
Is it doable? Yes. Using Google Scholar citations might be a "cleaner" metric for academic erasure, but Google Searches captures the broader societal erasure (the "standard account" circulated in the public imagination). Both would powerfully justify why a figure like Maggie Walker deserves a "Major" spot over the more searchable figures of the Progressive Era.

2. Mary Richmond: The Emperor (or The Hierophant)
Richmond would fit the archetype of The Emperor, representing authority, structure, and social control.
• The "Standard Account": She is credited with creating "scientific casework" to differentiate professional practice from misguided volunteer work.
• The Critical Reality: Her approach was rooted in "character" as a deficit, placing the onus of resolving systemic problems like poverty and racism on the individual rather than the system.
• Tarot Meaning: As The Emperor, she represents the "disciplined and orderly" side of the profession that acted as a lay-police force, conducting surveillance in the private homes of the poor. Her card would embody the "medical model" and the "professionalization of social work"—a manifestation of neoliberalism that helps clients "adapt" to oppression rather than dismantling it.
I think Jane Adamas should be the pope. The standard of high morals, but firmly embedded in colonial institutions. 

I see Jane Adamas as the pope (V).

1 Troubling the Standard Account  
of Social Work 
The Standard Account 
Roland Chrisjohn and Sherri Young describe what they call the “standard  account” of Indian residential schools, suggesting that this most frequently  encountered version of history and its legacy frames what these institutions were  and, therefore, what should be thought, felt, and done about them today.1 They  show how the standard account misrepresents and depoliticizes the history of  Indian residential schools in Canada and the United States. Although distinct,  we can also say there’s a “standard account” of social work’s emergence – a spe cific history that is normatively taught in social work classrooms and reiterated  in social work texts. 
The standard account of social work history places the origins of social work  in England with organizations that “organized” charities and early social justice  establishments called settlement houses.* Brought to North America, these two  models were taken up by well-meaning upper and middle class white people  who spread their social work knowledge and practice across the continent.  Copyright © 2019. University of Toronto Press. All rights reserved.
These histories commonly name Mary Richmond and Jane Addams as the two  key founders of the profession in North America. They were associated, respec tively, with the Charity Organization Society (COS) and the settlement house  movement.2 The COS is either depicted uncritically as developing “scientific”  casework or depicted critically as politically conservative and moralizing, with  the example that they sent ruling class “friendly visitors” into poor people’s  
* See note 2 for a discussion of a significant number of texts’ relationship to the standard  account. Importantly, there is existing work that challenges the standard account by, for  example, examining the important role of Black people in establishing social work or critiquing  social work’s role in settler colonialism and white supremacy.

homes to tell them how to live properly. The settlement house movement, in  contrast, is framed by the standard account as progressive, often as politically  radical, and as working towards improving conditions of poor communities  through community and political organizing. 
This standard account has variations, situated more or less coherently on dif ferent positions along the political spectrum. In its liberal version, settlement  houses with their radical community organizing and social transformation  work are nicely complemented by the more individually oriented casework,  creating a harmonious and diverse foundation for all subsequent social work.3 In its radical iteration, the settlement houses and Addams are held in sharp  contrast to the COS and framed as what social work should strive to be.4 What  the liberal and radical versions share is a common understanding that these two  distinct spheres of interventions into the social world mark out the parameters  of what social work was and can ever be. 
While it’s undoubtedly true that there’s much to learn from Addams and the  settlement movement, we discuss why it’s a mistake to hold these interventions  only as positive examples and/or as entirely positive examples. Parallel to the  simplification of Addams and the settlement movement, Richmond and the  COS are also treated in the standard account with less complexity than their his 
tories demand. First, they are sometimes represented as the right-wing extreme  of problematic, classist, and control-oriented social work, which is far from  how they viewed themselves. This self-perception is important if we consider  contemporary social work and how practitioners view themselves today: while  some front-line workers imagine themselves radical, we’ve personally never met  social work professionals who claim to be any further to the right of the political  spectrum than liberal. The majority of social workers appear to feel that they’re  aligned with left of centre political critique. Yet, surely this self-perception does  something to hamper critiques of social work – whether from scholars, clients,  or community groups. Our concern is that claims of relative innocence enable  Copyright © 2019. University of Toronto Press. All rights reserved.
social workers to acknowledge structural violences in social work but to imag ine that they result from the cumulative actions of other social workers who are  conservative and intend social control. If no actual social workers imagine them selves as part of this complicit conservative community, nobody will change  their practices in light of the already widely circulating critiques. But if both  liberal and radical social workers have been implicated in interlocking oppres sions ever since the emergence of professional social work, the implications for  contemporary ethics and politics are very different. 
Implicit in and alongside the polarized framing of the settlement movement  versus the COS is a framing in which all casework and immediate meeting of  needs are imagined to be conservative and all community-level interventions

are imagined to be more aligned with radical politics. This chapter discusses  examples that deconstruct this framing: the “direct action casework” practised  by the Ontario Coalition Against Poverty, on the one hand, and the externally  imposed community relocations of Regent Park and Africville, on the other. 
Only a thin selection of the work of either Addams and Richmond and their  respective movements (settlement houses and COSs) gets gleaned from a much  more complex history, and this partial representation is then held as the found ing, and ongoing, struggle (or harmonious diversity) of social work – which  also functions to mark out the parameters within which social work inevitably  operates. This chapter problematizes this oversimplification, with the hope that  such a critical examination might impact the way in which today’s social work ers think of themselves, their relationship to history, and their part in creating  what will be known as history tomorrow. 
The Pull of the Other Side of the River 
Radical iterations of the standard account of social work history follow a pat tern often found in radical analysis. In this pattern, there are very clear dividing  lines between those responsible for oppression and those opposed to, and/or  subjected to, oppression. The pattern is poetically illustrated in The Motorcycle  Diaries,5 a film adaptation of the memoir of the same title by Argentinian Marx ist revolutionary Ernesto “Che” Guevara. Recapping this scene, Miguel Alfonso  Cañero writes: 
At the San Pablo leper colony, [friends Ernesto and Alberto] spend three weeks  helping treat patients, [and] they learn that the doctors and nurses all stay on one  side of the riverbank and the leper patients on the other. Right away Ernesto and  Alberto break the rules and get in trouble – they shake hands with the patients  without wearing gloves … [T]he two friends quickly bond with the patients.6

Shortly thereafter, Ernesto swims across the river to celebrate his birthday with  the patients rather than with the doctors, nurses, and ruling class volunteers.  Crossing the river represents his radicalization: he leaves behind the life of a  ruling class medical student and aligns himself with the poor and disadvantaged –  no longer tethered to them through stratified helping in which he is exalted as  morally superior, but symbolically becoming one with them, sharing their space.  His journey across the river is heavy with symbolism. At first only the doctors,  nurses, and other volunteers know what he’s doing. They beg him to come back  for fear that he’ll be swept away or get eaten by animals. Their only response is  panic and fear. Slowly the folks in the leper colony become aware that something

is moving in the water. They gather at the edge of the riverbank and cheer when  they realize it’s Ernesto coming to join them. He chooses them over the ruling  classes he’d previously been aligned with, and everybody on both sides of the  river clearly understands the significance of this choice. 
However moving, poetic, and perhaps accurate in depicting something he  really did, the structure of this representation of radicalization is not unique  to Che Guevara. Jane Addams’s symbolic moment is said to have been while  watching a bullfight in Spain. Moved by the animal’s suffering and the crowd’s  inhumanity, she consolidated previous concerns about injustice and indignity,  vowing to forever side with the downtrodden and not the oppressors.7 Presum 
ably both of these radicalization stories are factual, and both were surely sig nificant. Probably many of us have our own analogous turning point moments.  But to situate your life and efforts forevermore on a straightforward and unam biguous “other side of the river” of justice and solidarity – participating in that  imaginary of good versus bad, or of innocent versus guilty – isn’t the only pos sibility for committing oneself to radical social transformation. 
Material and symbolic lines divide rich from poor, disabled from nondis abled,8 colonizer from colonized,9 and so on. Work that identifies and chal lenges these lines is crucial. But whether our personal-is-political ethical align ments10 are most helpfully mapped onto such dividing lines is another question  
altogether. 
Even with a figure such as Che, it may be politically dangerous to imagine  anyone as always and only aligned with justice and the oppressed, as often comes  to light when one employs interlocking analyses of oppression. For example,  some male Black civil rights and liberation leaders like Martin Luther King Jr and  Malcom X* had problematic views on gender issues;11 a number of socialist and  anarchist social justice activists, including Emma Goldman,12 were eugenicists;  and troubling questions have been raised about Gandhi’s relationship with the  “untouchable” caste.13 Just as is true of Addams, so too should Guevara, Gold Copyright © 2019.

man, Gandhi, King, and Malcolm X be celebrated for their important work. They  did much that needs to be honoured, and we can learn from each of them. But  
* White supremacy frames Black men as hyperpatriarchal, which is racist and false. Many Black  male organizers and intellectuals – such as Frederick Douglass, W.E.B. Du Bois, Bayard Rustin,  James Baldwin, and Huey Newton – have supported feminism. Please see bell hooks’s chapter  “Plantation Patriarchy” and Rudolph Byrd and Beverly Guy-Sheftall’s edited collection Traps:  African American Men on Gender and Sexuality. It’s important to acknowledge how interlocked  oppressions are discursively divided and how they get played against one another. In tension  with this point, it’s also important to remember that perfection or innocence is always unat tainable for all of us.

Troubling the Standard Account of Social Work 29 
celebrating their work isn’t best facilitated by positioning them as always and only  on the side of justice and righteousness, as represented by Che crossing the river. Thomas King cites a different representation of rivers,14 implying a distinct  personal-is-political ethics, which is also a different way of imagining that our  lives are shaped within the parameters of legacies of oppression. King says that  Pueblo people understand “evil and good … not so much [as] distinct and  opposing entities [but] as … tributaries of the same river.” This world view, he  says, enables “the tantalizing question of what else one might do if confronted  with the appearance of evil.”15 Maybe care and disinterest, responsibility and  irresponsibility, and work towards justice and participation in injustice are all  tributaries on the same river, rather than opposing one another like riverbanks.  Could this imaginary open up other possibilities when we encounter “evil” –  whether in ourselves or others? Maybe distancing ourselves from violence  perpetration, oppression, and complicity isn’t our only option. Distancing our selves and casting ourselves as innocent makes it less likely we will reflect upon  harm we cause, and upon oppression in which we participate or from which  we benefit. What would it mean for our ethical and political journeys – for our  
lives – if we truly believed there was no “other side” at which to arrive? Gayatri Spivak also uses a water metaphor to illustrate a critical intervention  into norms relating to responsibility and complicity: “The mainstream has never  run clean, perhaps never can. Part of mainstream education involves learning to  ignore this absolutely, with a sanctioned ignorance.”16 For Spivak, one responsi bility of the critic, the activist, or the helper17 is to “provide a persistent dredg ing operation” of the mainstream. However, she cautions that this activity “is  counterproductive when it becomes a constant and self-righteous shaming of  fully intending subjects.”18 She’s suggesting that people don’t always act with the  straightforward intention to do what they do, to achieve a desired harmful end,  and with full awareness of how they affect others. Spivak takes complicity very  seriously in reflections on her own participation in oppression.19 She proposes  Copyright © 2019. University of Toronto Press. All rights reserved.
that such caution needs to inform our critique: “There often seems no choice  between excuses and accusations, the muddy stream and mudslinging.”20 How,  then, can we critically engage a fruitful “complicity between our own position  and theirs?”21 Spivak challenges her readers to move beyond “excuses and accu 
sations” so that they “may then discover a constructive … complicity.”22 Swimming across the river, or cultivating clear political commitments, is  very important. But we also have to interrogate where this particular river  has come from and where it leads today. We have to interrogate how the river  shapes us even when we insist we’ve emerged on the other side. This is the  image of responsibility-taking represented by Spivak’s river: we need to clearly  take political and ethical stances, but we need to do so in a way that recognizes

30 Deconstructing Social Work and Social Work History 
that we and our stances have been shaped by the very legacies that we’re strug gling against; we’re never outside of the river and its effects. Sara Ahmed reso nantly invites us to concretely trace “how racism operates to shape the surfaces  of bodies and worlds … [so that] we become ‘us’ as an effect” of racism.23 Per haps we have to cross to the other side of the river without ever forgetting that  the river itself is part of the problem and that any crossing is always going to be  somewhat partial and imaginary. 
Working with the standard account of social work, we show in this chapter  that the radical side of the river is much less consistently radical or social  justice–oriented than it’s usually represented. We also discuss how the con servative side of the river is much more liberal or politically centrist than  is usually allowed, fancying itself rather a “safe middle ground.”24 What’s  more, although both sides of the river in the standard account of social work  history imagined themselves to be working for a better society, for social  transformation, they were both also deeply implicated in serious violence  and oppression, and much more centrally involved in interlocking structural  violences than is usually acknowledged. We’re not suggesting that there was  no difference between the two sides or that there is no truth to the standard  account’s positioning of them, but it certainly isn’t consistently true. This  well-known version of social work history limits and shapes what we can  know about our past. It therefore also limits and shapes what we can imagine  and interrogate about our present and our efforts towards the future. 
Following Saba Mahmood, we conceptualize the standard account of social  work as an “authoritative discursive tradition.” Participation in this tradition  enables certain kinds of ethical self-governance, reflexive self-interrogation,  and collective analysis, and it prevents others.25 It shapes who and what we can  become and, cumulatively, what social work and even our world can become. If  we believe we can align ourselves with social justice and against social control  and oppression by aligning ourselves with Addams, then we may be setting  Copyright © 2019.

ourselves up as immune to the possibility that (like Addams, in fact) we are  actively complicit and engaged in forms of oppression – which is an immunity  none of us can ever achieve. 
Charity Organization Societies: Beyond Friendly  
Visiting to the Poor 
The Charity Organization Society (COS) was founded in England in 1869,26 and  was originally called the Society for Organising Charitable Relief and Repress ing Mendacity (“mendacity” means dishonesty or fraud).27 The founding coin cided with the passing of the “Goschen Minute,” a policy that attempted to

strengthen the 1834 New Poor Law’s deterrence of charity and further restricted  giving outdoor relief to poor people. “Outdoor relief ” is relief given outside  of sites of confinement such as workhouses, poorhouses, asylums, and jails.28 The relationship between this era’s charity and its practices of dehumanizing  confinement were intimate from the beginning. The first US COS chapter was  founded in 1877 in Buffalo, New York.29 Sometimes called COSs, sometimes  called Associated Charities, chapters sprung up across North America, with  the first in Canada established in 1881.30 Within eleven years, the number of  friendly visitors in the United States tripled.31 In 1911, the (US) National Asso 
ciation of Societies for Organizing Charity (NASOC) was founded, and within  three years it had 143 member organizations.32 By 1912, Canada had at least  four COSs: Toronto, Montréal, Winnipeg, and London.33 
In social work history, COSs are most famous for “friendly visiting,” in which  ruling class volunteers would visit, typically, between two and four poor fami lies on a regular basis. According to Mary Richmond, when people see those in  need, they generally mistakenly “interfere by sending help,” which “often does  more harm than good, and becomes a temptation rather than a help.” As an  alternative, she advocated for what she called a scientific approach, involving  friendly visitors (and later professional caseworkers) “who would seek out and,  with patience and sympathy, strive to remove the causes of need.” In doing so,  friendly visitors might offer advice on alcohol consumption or spending, but  they worked towards no changes to the capitalist system that allows a certain  percentage of the population to live without enough food, sufficient shelter, and  other necessities. Yet, Richmond described friendly visiting as a means by which  “social conditions could be wonderfully improved.”34 This claim is an astound 
ing example of what Leslie Margolin critiques as “the healing power of class.”35 It’s troubling that Richmond would claim that this approach would improve  “social conditions,” and this legacy of imagining political change through indi vidual interventions based upon the ruling classes’ imagined moral superiority  Copyright © 2019.

lives on today. That the political solution to poverty could be cumulative visits  from ruling class people who offer advice, and who ensure that poor people  receive only the most necessary and minimal material relief, if any at all, clearly  depoliticizes poverty and inequality. 
Although she grew up a poor orphan, much of Richmond’s work denigrates  poor people as morally reprehensible. Richmond recognized the significance  of social context, but what’s perhaps most relevant to contemporary framings  of political issues is how she did so a century ago. She writes: “The personal  and social causes of poverty act and react upon each other, changing places as  cause and effect, until they form a tangle that no hasty, impatient jerking can  unravel.”36 This statement seems pretty balanced, in theory. Yet, her framing

32 Deconstructing Social Work and Social Work History 
goes totally askew when put into practice. She says, for example, of pauper  fathers, whom she calls “married vagabonds”: 
There is a sense in which he is not responsible for his faults; but there is a sense in  which we are none of us responsible for ours, and when we are once permanently  committed to this view of ourselves, there is no health in us. To treat the married  vagabond as not responsible, is only to increase his irresponsibility.37 
Richmond says there’s a sense in which the married vagabond’s difficulties are  determined by “political, industrial, and charitable conditions.”38 She makes this  political critique, but then depoliticizes the specificity of how capitalism and  classism operate in the lives of poor men, saying that we’re all partly shaped by  these social and political conditions. Her concluding point effectively negates  the political critique she just seemed to advance. In her final analysis, the mar 
ried vagabond is solely responsible for ending his own poverty. Poverty is not  a collective or social responsibility, even if she acknowledges a political dimen sion to poverty. In this and other instances, Richmond, when discussing real  poor people, stresses individual responsibility. That stance makes her politically  a liberal and much more consistent with most social work done today than is  widely acknowledged. 
The role of the friendly visitor was to evaluate the worthiness of the house hold to receive material aid and to be a mentor to the poor. For example, the  London, Ontario, COS maintained: “We must strive to promote habits of thrift  and industry.”39 Friendly visitors were expected to present themselves as con cerned neighbours rather than as representatives of a particular organization.  Yet, their visits were not neighbourly or even “friendly.” The New York COS’s  guidelines encouraged visitors to arrive unexpectedly, rather than at a consis tent time or day40 – likely so that the poor people they observed, scrutinized,  and categorized could not make their house tidier than it usually was, hide alco Copyright © 2019.

hol, or otherwise put on the appearance that they were doing what the ruling  classes expected of the so-called deserving poor. The spread of friendly visiting  therefore expanded ruling class surveillance of the poor. As Margolin notes:  “Prior to social work, political surveillance was more or less restricted to public  domains – streets, businesses, schools. With social work, however, it became  possible to keep track of marginal and common people in their homes as they  pursued the most personal activities.”41 
Visitors were discouraged, or forbidden in some chapters, from giving  material aid (food, clothes, money, and so on.) to those they visited.42 COSs  “organized” charity, as opposed to distributing it.

what they called “indiscriminate relief,” which they viewed as contributing to  social problems, and they worked “to check the evils of over-lapping of relief”43 – by  which a poor person or family might receive material assistance, such as food  or money, from more than one source. “Repressing mendacity,” as their original  name put it, or catching what is today referred to as “welfare fraud,” was central  to their work. 
COSs documented who received which forms of aid from whom in order  to ensure that poor people weren’t collecting more than they were imagined to  be entitled to. They considered charities to be “United, an Army – Divided,  a Mob” that encouraged laziness and bred pauperism rather than eliminating  it.44 According to the New York COS, “Many cases are getting aid who can earn  their own support, but prefer the easier way … Aid must be cut off from all who  have means, or can earn their own living, or are making a bad use of help.”45 Consequently, the COS campaigned to abolish relief for those they considered  “undeserving.” COS activism successfully led to the end of nearly all outdoor  relief programs in large cities in the United States by 1900.46 
As outdoor relief dwindled due to COS efforts, the specialization and subspe cialization of confinement was spreading – continuing a trajectory of expanding  the sheer number of people confined and the diversity of sites of confinement,  which had really begun about fifty years previously.47 These innovative institu tions, including asylums, poorhouses, prisons, and various kinds of medical  and/or educational institutions for disabled people, never had any difficulty  filling their beds, in spite of high rates of illness and untimely death, alongside  highly questionable positive outcomes from the very beginning. 
In line with the day’s ethos, an 1891 report on the Ontario prison and refor matory system advocated the straightforward mass confinement of those  deemed untrainable at the Ontario Hospital in Orillia, alongside establishing  what would now be called special education. These classes were to be estab lished only for those deemed “capable of being trained,” who would be taught  Copyright © 2019. University of Toronto Press. All rights reserved.
life skills by social workers. The same report also called for the imposition of  institutions designed to reform youth considered in need of a “reformation of  character.” These youth were to be “detained until the reformation is attained  irrespective of the time required”48 – that is to say, until they met gender  appropriate, heteronormative, white ruling class behavioural standards. The  report stated that these institutions were not intended as punitive; however,  in practice they were almost universally punitive and barely distinguishable  from penal imprisonment – not surprising, given how intimately such sites  and their practices developed alongside and interlocked with penal impris onment. Furthermore, the stated rehabilitative orientation justified confining  people for their entire lives or for their remaining childbearing years (which

was also applied to some folks arrested for crimes at this time, if they were also  considered disabled).* 
Surely the expansion of such sites during this period can be largely attrib uted to the diminished possibility of any relief outside of sites of confinement,49 which again resulted from the work of the COS. When the COS campaigned  against outdoor relief, they were in effect campaigning for imprisonment and  institutionalization as responses to poverty. What’s more, by around 1900 –  when people were first called social workers – many of the relatively new sites  of confinement had largely abandoned their short-lived optimism about edu cation, community reintegration, and other such stated objectives. They were  now growing due to their openly stated efficiency in removing those considered  to be social burdens and restricting them from procreating, as a result of the  dovetailing spread of eugenics, which held that only those deemed “fit” should  reproduce.50 COS campaigns against outdoor relief thus confined people to  institutional sites that nobody pretended were helpful to those they housed. 
Poverty was often described as a literal disease or infestation needing eradi cation.51 Reverend William Baldwin, representing Toronto’s Associated Chari ties (again, another name of the COS), clearly articulated the movement’s drive  to eradicate poor people: “To keep them in comfortable quarters and allow  them to live in idleness is not the way to get rid of them. Hard work and strict  discipline … [are] the best means of getting rid of the professional vagrant.”52 A  report summarizing Baldwin’s statement called poor people an “army of tramps  that infest this Province.”53 The advocated cure was often to restrict all relief.  And, for those who remained unable to more closely align with ruling class  social mores even when all assistance was taken away as an enactment of instru mental violence,† the COS promoted the implementation of newly emergent  eugenic principles that sought to eradicate poor and otherwise “unfit” people.54 
Sir Francis Galton first articulated eugenic doctrine in 1865 and later coined  the actual word in 1883.55 Eugenics became an incredibly popular ideology in  Copyright © 2019. University of Toronto Press. All rights reserved.
which those considered “fit” were encouraged to reproduce while those con sidered “unfit” were discouraged from reproducing. This aim was first accom plished through institutional segregated incarceration for one’s entire life, or

throughout the childbearing years; sterilization was only later added to the  eugenic arsenal.56 Eugenic framings of “fitness” were those characteristics  already long exalted within moral economies of human value; those considered  unfit were diverse members of oppressed groups.57 
As part of its eugenic campaign, the COS published Oscar McCulloch’s early  and highly influential The Tribe of Ishmael: A Study in Social Degradation, which  he originally presented at the 1888 National Conference of Charities and Cor rections58 (later renamed the National Conference of Social Work). McCulloch  was the founder and leader of the Indianapolis chapter of the COS, and a leader  of the National Conference Standing Committee on Organization of Charities  in Cities.59 In The Tribe of Ishmael, this COS leader compared a poor family to “a  crustacean which has left the free, independent life common to its family, and is  living as a parasite, or pauper.”60 He described the family as a “pauper ganglion  of several hundreds,”61 argued that they were hereditarily unfit, and said that  indiscriminate aid had facilitated both their immorality and their reproduction.  This COS-published text was one of the earliest to instill fear in the general pub 
lic about both indiscriminate relief and the eugenic threat that poor, disabled,  and racialized people posed. While most of the family would be viewed as white  today (although white paupers were considered a distinct race in the usage of  the word at the time), some of the family’s “defects” are attributed to Indigenous  blood, which is personified as “wandering blood” and called “poison.”62 At the  time, it was common to connect Indigenous heritage with eugenic unfitness,  including among white people who were considered politically progressive.63 
In response to the question “What can we do?”, McCulloch answers: “First,  we must close up official out-door relief. Second, we must check private and  indiscriminate benevolence … Third, we must get hold of the children.”64 
The same decade that McCulloch presented his study to fellow charity work ers in 1888, Galton coined the term “eugenics,” and Nova Scotia began imple menting child welfare policy.65 The emergence of societies for the prevention  Copyright © 2019. University of Toronto Press. All rights reserved.
of cruelty and later children’s aid societies is told in social work histories as  motivated by care, and surely that was part of the picture.66 But in these new  organizations, care was defined and policed by those who apprehended chil dren; it was not measured by the children themselves, their families, or their  communities.* In this same historical moment, the COS published McCulloch’s  study that explicitly advocated child apprehension for eugenic reasons.67 It was

believed that by apprehending children and preventing more from being born,  initially through the eugenically motivated expansion of gender-segregated sites  called “indoor relief ”68 and later through sterilization,69 the problem of pauper ism would be ended without redistributing wealth. If paupers were prevented  from reproducing, then the remaining “fit” would be free to participate in com petitive capitalist society without having to support an underclass. According to  this ideology, heredity and social deficiency caused poverty, not the economic  system. That said, eugenics was a hybrid of cultural determinism and biological  determinism. Inferior culture caused inferior physiology and vice versa. This  doctrine enabled culturally oriented eugenic practices such as forced labour  and child apprehension, as well as biologically oriented eugenic practices such  as sexual sterilization. For eugenicists, these varied strategies were part of a  common political and moral struggle. 
US COS chapters also campaigned to pass “ugly laws” – ordinances forbid ding disabled people from panhandling. As Susan Schweik observes: “Where  Charity Organization Society went, ugly law did not necessarily follow, but from  the 1880s on, when ugly laws occurred, Charity Organization Society leaders all  evidently had a hand in the development of the social category of the unsightly  beggar.”70 Those considered to be the undeserving poor had long been criminal ized. These new laws demonized people who had previously been categorized  as the deserving poor – they criminalized disabled people and framed them as  a menace to society.71 
The COS restricted people’s access to outdoor relief, which again is material  assistance that people receive while continuing to live in their own homes, thus  forcing people to choose between starvation and institutionalization. In some  places, COS-sponsored ugly laws against panhandling also removed a source of  income that people could acquire for themselves while living in their own home or  community, and removed those people to workhouses, jails, or other institutions  if they broke the laws. It’s important to note that there was nothing “conservative”  Copyright © 2019. University of Toronto Press. All rights reserved.
about this intervention: it didn’t seek to keep things as they’d traditionally been. The COS also dedicated significant resources to uncovering those they  believed were falsely claiming to be disabled in order to more successfully gar ner money. Even those who were considered legitimately disabled were con structed as fraudulent.72 Like other marginalized groups, disabled people were  portrayed in these laws and in surrounding charity discourse as fundamentally  immoral. This depiction relied upon and carried forward a moral economy  dividing valuable humans from worthless ones.73 
Some COS chapters even played a direct role in the penal incarceration of  paupers: COS members acted “as lay-police to go among the crowds detecting  and arresting beggars.”74 In 1897, New York City’s police chief instructed his

officers to work with the COS because of their “special knowledge of this class  and their schemes.” COS agents also testified against poor and disabled people  who violated ugly laws, vagrancy laws, and anti-panhandling laws, and thus  played a primary role in their confinement to workhouses, jails, asylums, and  other institutions.75 
Initially, many of those convicted of violating an ugly law were sent to poor houses.76 These institutions were miserable places.77 New Orleans’s Shakespeare  Alms House, for example, only allowed people to leave once a week, and many  died there.78 This history coincided with sites of confinement becoming increas ingly specialized;79 through this development, poorhouse sentences became less  common for violating an ugly law, and jail sentences became the norm.80 
However they rationalized or understood their efforts, North American  COSs led coordinated campaigns to criminalize and incarcerate poor and dis abled people, to force them into more desperate poverty, and to frame their  oppression as caused by their faulty biology. 
Across North America, COS chapters worked to eliminate the visibility of  poverty, while keeping existing economic and social systems intact. Without a  doubt, the COS assisted some poor people in certain ways, but it only ever did  so in ways that would also benefit the wealthy and support the political status  quo. Among other things, COS workers were told to be careful not to incite  revolutionary fervour or “uppityness.” The London, Ontario, COS warned: “Be  careful not to make the poor discontented; incite their ambition for what they  may obtain, but do not make them strive for what they cannot hope to accom plish. Their lot is hard enough, and your aim is to cheer and strengthen.”81 
The history we present of the COS here is brief, and there were important  differences between COS chapters in different places – for example, we are  unaware of ugly laws passed in Canada.

out of plainly and explicitly eugenic motivations. A narrow focus on friendly  visiting, scientific charity, and casework helps construct one of the two found ing movements of social work as problematic but not really central to systemic  violences against long-targeted populations and their moral denigration in  popular, professional, and scholarly discourse. Discussions of the ugly laws and  The Tribe of Ishmael feature prominently in discourse about eugenics, especially  in disability scholarship, but the leadership role that the emergent social work  profession played in these and other eugenic practices is largely left out of many  histories of social work. Furthermore, as we explore in more detail further on,  we will see it was not only the COS wing of early social work that led the eugen 
ics movement. In this regard, the COS worked in tandem with the progressive  and radical activists associated with settlement houses, all in apparent agree ment that poor and disabled people who don’t live according to ruling class  social mores are best incarcerated in gender-segregated sites in order to prevent  
further generations of those whom they all agreed were “defective.” The history of eugenics forces a re-evaluation of the commonly accepted  political spectrum ranging from right-wing reactionaries to left-wing radicals.  Liberals and radicals alike, whether Marxist, feminist, anarchist, or other, tended  to work for eugenic aims a century ago.82 Organized opposition to eugenics  came almost entirely from the Catholic Church, and was animated by uphold ing conservative values in a way that many Catholics would say are entirely  consistent with conservative Catholic values and contemporary Catholic activ ism against euthanasia and abortion.83 In a truly conservative world view, each  person has their proper place,* and it is not appropriate to interfere in this natu ral, divine, or traditional order. Poor and disabled people should therefore not  be eradicated; their lives should be defended like any other. But the social and  political landscape should not be shifted in their favour; it should be conserved  as is.

and actively working towards that end. In broad strokes, liberals like Richmond  believed political change should happen through cumulative individual hard  work with as little outside interference in personal choice and liberty as pos sible (including the “interference” of charity), while radicals tended to believe  in collective efforts towards more fundamental changes directly targeting the

social order. However, like liberalism, radical political action and organizing  was viewed as perfectly harmonious with eugenics. This radical complicity in  eugenic activism offers an important lesson that those of us who consider our selves radical today should reflect very carefully upon. 
Settlement Houses and Jane Addams 
The settlement movement is typically depicted in the standard account as oppo sitional to the COS. The settlement movement often highlighted political and  social causes of poverty, rather than blaming individual poor people for the con ditions in which they lived. Jane Addams was critical of those who “believed that  poverty was synonymous with vice and laziness … [and who thus] blamed the  individual.”84 Settlement workers engaged in political campaigns and organized  community services.85 The standard account of social work places the origin of  settlement houses, like the origin of the COS, in the United Kingdom (although,  as we discuss in the next chapter, this selective history erases the influence of Black  community organizing on Addams and the settlement movement). There were  
only six settlement houses in the United States in 1891, but over 400 by 1910.86 Evangelia Settlement, founded in Toronto in 1902, was the first settlement  house in Canada that espoused the values of the settlement movement. Can ada, with a smaller population and slower urbanization and industrialization  processes, never saw the proliferation of settlement houses that took place in  the United States.87 By 1920, there were thirteen settlement houses in Canada.88 The most famous settlement house in North America was Hull-House in  Chicago, which was co-founded by Jane Addams and had 2,000 visitors a week  by its second year of operations.89 In the standard account of social work his tory, Addams was the central figure in the settlement house movement, a key  founder of social work and, in particular, of radical social work. Much of this  portrayal is justified. A small sample of the many services available through  Copyright © 2019. University of Toronto Press. All rights reserved.
Hull-House included a coffee house and a community kitchen; the Hull-House  Cooperative Coal Association and the Jane Club for working women were  developed to help people reduce energy costs and cover rent costs, respectively.  The settlement house also offered a kindergarten, a free health clinic, a sewing  house, educational programs for children and adults, and a shelter for homeless  women.90 In addition, Hull-House had a gymnasium, which Addams reported  “gradually performed a mission of its own and became something of a social  center to the neighborhood.”91 
Addams deserves to be celebrated for her efforts and accomplishments. Her  writing and activism remain relevant within social work and beyond, and much  of it is still applicable today. In addition to fighting against war and imperialism

and struggling for women’s, children’s, and workers’ rights, Addams also advo cated for the rights of Black people: she was an early member of the National  Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP),92 and she spoke  out publicly against both lynching and glorified depictions of lynching and  other racism in the Hollywood blockbuster Birth of a Nation.93 
Addams was also deeply critical of the COS and friendly visiting. She cri tiqued the moralistic underpinning of the COS and suggested that poor com munities are characterized by a higher ethical standard by which neighbours  assist one another. She wrote, “A most striking incongruity, at once apparent, is  the difference between the emotional kindness with which relief is given by one  poor neighbor to another poor neighbor and the guarded care with which relief  is given by a charity visitor to a charity recipient,” which she describes as “an  absolute clashing of two ethical standards.”94 For Addams, COS interventions  into the social and ethical realm of a poor community were damaging. Addams  advocated that practices and moralities in poor communities should not be  displaced. Within poor communities, she said, “the fact that the economic  condition of all alike is on a most precarious level makes the ready outflow of  sympathy and material assistance the most natural thing in the world.” This  communal precarity results in what she exalted as “self-sacrifice quite unknown  in the circles where greater economic advantages make that kind of intimate  knowledge of one’s neighbors impossible.”95 
The neighbourly assistance Addams celebrated and admired was given without  means tests, background checks to ensure that nobody else was helping the person  or family, lectures about how to live a more moral or thrifty life, or otherwise blam ing and shaming people for their poverty. If someone expressed a need to another  person who could meet it, the other person would respond with the needed assis tance, she said. For Addams, then, the world would do much better with more  people acculturated to poor communities’ ethical standards rather than to ruling  class ones. This conviction is one of the main lessons of her book Democracy and  Copyright © 2019. University of Toronto Press. All rights reserved.
Social Ethics: American “democracy” would only live up to its stated ideals if every one could be more aligned with the ethical standards and social mores already  abundantly found in poor communities and under attack by the COS. 
Addams also criticized friendly visitors specifically for lecturing and mor alizing about “industrial virtues and housewifely training,” which they them selves usually had no first-hand experience of doing.96 Addams’s own genera tion of ruling class, university-educated, white women did little, if any, cleaning  
and other housework. Yet, while volunteering for the COS, many instructed  poor women on how to do these things. 
According to Addams, encounters with real, living, poor people confront the  ruling class visitor with the stark contrast between people’s real lives and what

she’s been led to believe. As a result, Addams said, she “discovers how incor rigibly bourgeois her standards have been, and it takes but a little time to reach  the conclusion that she cannot insist so strenuously upon the conventions of  her own class.”97 Interestingly, Addams articulated these various critiques of the  COS and its work within her conceptualization of a radical view of democracy.  For Addams, democracy goes well beyond “a sentiment which desires the well being of all” or a “belie[f] in the essential dignity and equality of all.”98 Democ racy, she said, also demands “a rule of living” from each of us, by which “all must  turn out for one another, and at least see the size of one another’s burdens.”99 What she called democratic or “social ethics” relies upon being exposed to the  real-life experiences of one another. She claimed that the “democratic spirit …  implies that diversified human experience and resultant sympathy … are the  foundation and guarantee of Democracy.”100 Addams promoted a democracy  that recognizes inequality, difference, and diversity. This democracy demands  exalted people to recognize that we don’t all carry the same burden or struggle,  
and that we therefore have uneven responsibilities to address inequalities. In this and many other respects, Addams was indeed a radical. Her operation alization of “democracy” is entirely distinct from Richmond, for example, who  called it undemocratic to “run howling to Washington, asking special legislation  for our troubles.”101 That Richmond construed special legislation in response to  political problems as “undemocratic” shows yet again her consistent emphasis  on individual effort as the only acceptable means to transform society. That said, like the rest of us, Addams wasn’t consistent in her political efforts.  Hull-House implemented a screening system for people applying for relief  from private charities: the Hull-House Bureau of Labour and Charitable Reg istration.102 Not very different from the COS in this regard, Addams had “been  working since 1892 to encourage charities to systematize their relief efforts.”103 Further, Margolin asserts that Addams was “far from egalitarian,” in that she  advocated that ruling class folks have a duty to help poor people because of  Copyright © 2019.

their “financial resources … sensibilities and education.”104 This attitude is  what Barbara Heron problematizes as the bourgeois “helping imperative,”105 which relies on the exaltation of ruling class sensibilities and mores (however  much Addams also significantly worked against this exaltation in other ways). 
The New “Social Work” 
Richmond and Addams were two key figures in a period known as the “Pro gressive Era,” which is widely hailed as a heyday of social transformation and  optimism about forging a better world. If we consider that many social service  users – now and then – experience social workers as unjustly intruding upon

42 Deconstructing Social Work and Social Work History 
their lives, it is curious that professional “social work” emerged at this “progres sive” time. Addams, on the front lines of many political struggles of the day,  believed that what came to be known as the new “social work” represented the  most drastic transition of her day: “Probably there is no relation in life which  our democracy is changing more rapidly than the charitable relation – that rela tion which obtains between benefactor and beneficiary; at the same time there  is no point of contact in our modern experience which reveals so clearly the  lack of that equality which democracy implies.”106 What Addams called “social  ethics” and deemed necessary for true democracy requires an equality that  simply doesn’t exist. She therefore called on ruling class people to embrace an  “identification with the common lot which is the essential idea of Democracy  [that] becomes the source and expression of social ethics.”107 She asserted that  if ruling class people were empathetic with poor or otherwise oppressed people  (the common lot), if ruling class people could better identify with them, then  real democracy could be achieved. 
Addams’s articulation of social ethics as an orientation to guide the relations  of rich and poor certainly differentiates her from Richmond’s suggestion “that  social conditions could be wonderfully improved if, to every family in distress,  could be sent a volunteer visitor.”108 Entirely distinct moral economies are at  play here. In one, the normatively exalted ruling class subject challenges her  own exaltation through identification with the common lot. If any individual  transformation is being stressed in Addams’s schema, the target is the indi vidual who is on top of social stratifications, and their transformation is only a  step towards fundamental political transformation and the ending of inequality.  This change, according to Addams, is facilitated through contact with the com 
mon lot and learning from their morally superior social ethics of reciprocal and  nonjudgmental give and take. In Richmond, we are invited into an entirely dif ferent moral economy in which the ruling classes are unquestionably morally  and intellectually superior.

mation, and, through such cumulative individual transformation, “social con ditions could be wonderfully improved.”109 Addams’s and Richmond’s working  definitions of democracy point to a significant gap between them, as do their  suggestions for how ruling class people should orient their engagement with  oppressed groups. 
What is somewhat curious, then, is that Addams and Richmond were (and  are) so widely considered to be working together towards one common pursuit –  the pursuit that was, for the first time, called “social work.” Nobody had ever  used the words “social work” or “social worker” before the twentieth century.  What the new term was intended to mean remains up for interpretation. Map

Troubling the Standard Account of Social Work 43 
the term “social work” or the title “social worker” is disputed, and the two sides  of the dispute favour either radical social transformation or well-trained mor ally superior workers efficiently instructing morally inferior individuals how to  better inhabit ruling class social mores. 
Describing one of these origin stories, Bradford Sheafor and Charles Horejsi  credit Jeffery Brackett of the Baltimore COS and Children’s Aid Society with  coining the term “social work” in the early 1900s. They explain: “He added  the word work to differentiate professional practice from what he considered  the often misguided and self-serving philanthropic activity of wealthy volun 
teers.”110 According to this origin story, Brackett came up with the term to  imply that the new profession was “orderly, responsible, and disciplined” –  exactly what liberals normatively say of the innovations of early social work. 
Rather than determining who really used the term and title “social work/er”  first, we’re more interested in tracing out what these origin stories do. Brack ett’s account stresses that “work” distinguished professional social workers from  untrained volunteers. In this version of the meaning of the new term and title,  “social” is thoroughly depoliticized, referring to “family members, friends, or  a myriad of other factors.”111 It is like a “systems theory” version of sociopoliti cal analysis – accounting primarily for local social arrangements and relations  without naming or addressing interlocking forces of oppression and structural  violences. This story marks a founding moment – the coining of the title – as  consistent with the COS’s purposes and its liberal legacy. It therefore grants  legitimacy to work done within this legacy. Authors who tell this story are likely  not aware that they’re legitimizing individual and depoliticized systems-level  casework and delegitimizing more radical social workings. However, reiterat ing this origin story does exactly that. And, at least in this particular iteration,  there’s no mention whatsoever of Addams, settlement houses, or fundamental  political change. 
The other version of events credits Simon Patten for coining the term. Patten  Copyright © 2019. University of Toronto Press. All rights reserved.
was more aligned with Addams and the quest for radical political transforma tion. Richard Ramsay provides an example of this radical version of the origins  of “social worker” and nicely sums up what we’ve been calling the radical ver sion of the history of social work’s standard account to provide context. In this  version of events, Patten coined the title “social worker” in 1900 as an umbrella  term for both the COS and settlement house movement. Ramsay says Patten’s  creation of this term “prompted a major dispute with Mary Richmond over the  issue of whether social workers should be social reform advocates or primarily  engaged in delivering individualized social services.”112 
In one version of the origin of the term “social work/er,” then, someone affili ated with the COS intends his new term to differentiate trained experts working

within local social conditions from untrained volunteers, and no mention is  made of the settlement house movement, oppression, or fundamental social  transformation. In the other version, the term describes both COS and settle ment workers, and is coined by someone who prefers the more politicized work  of the settlement movement. 
Addams and Richmond often come to stand for what are imagined to be  their straightforward and oppositional political orientations. Richmond, as  Ramsay says, “was deeply disturbed by Patten’s preference for group over indi vidual action,” and she “attacked his proposal that social workers advocate for  the elimination of the causes of poverty.”113 Ramsay highlights a number of dif ferences and points of dispute between the two women:  
Addams was a pacifist and a leader in the peace movement; Richmond supported  American involvement in the first Great War and developed services to aid mili tary families … Addams promoted social democracy and the amelioration of pov erty; Richmond promoted the art of differential treatment … Between 1910 and  1921, these two traded leadership positions in the National Conference of Chari ties and Corrections (NCCC).114 
In this account, the differences between these two women, their respective  organizations, and the forms of social work they have come to represent are  shown to be fundamentally oppositional. 
The depiction of the COS and the settlement movement, or of Richmond and  Addams, as straightforwardly oppositional is partial and somewhat misleading.  While there definitely were two conflicting political positions, an overemphasis  on this one divide (or on the complementary nature of the two positions in lib 
eral iterations) marginalizes multiple other stories that can just as legitimately  be told about the earliest “social workers” – such as stories of the COS and  settlement movements working in tandem for eugenics or stories of the social  Copyright © 2019.

workings left out of accounts of this polemic between two white factions. Origin stories matter to contemporary possibilities. If social work never had  anything to do with political activism and was largely concerned with becom ing more efficient at helping individuals, this heritage will impact how social  workers today imagine and reflect upon what they do. If the COS and settle ment movements complemented one another, political liberals occupying social  work roles can feel comfortable knowing that political forces have always been  central to social work, even if their own practice only focuses on the individual,  family, and relevant local systems. However, if there was a political struggle  about the nature of social work from the very beginning, in which Richmond  and the COS actively attempted to depoliticize the terrain of social work, then

there is an implicit invitation for each of us to “take sides.” The way this iteration  is told, we might be more likely to imagine ourselves as ethically and politically  aligned with Patten and Addams, however inaccurately that might characterize  our day-to-day tasks as social workers. But if we allow ourselves to wallow in the  river itself, dredging it as Spivak suggests – looking back at how we’ve arrived  to this point and looking forward to where we’re going – then maybe different  possibilities are available to us in reflecting upon our lives and roles today.115 A  persistent dredging operation into these tensions and the possible ways one can  position oneself within them requires us to complicate the two received sides of  the river. Earlier, we complicated Richmond and the COS’s frequent position ing as politically conservative, showing that they understood themselves to be  centrist or liberal as do the majority of social workers today. We also showed  that the COS was centrally involved in much more oppressive social workings  than are implied in many accounts of friendly visiting and early casework. We  now turn to the “other side of the river” in order to complicate the tendencies in  which Addams and the settlement movement cleanly represent radical politics. 
What the Established Riverbanks Obscure 
Addams was an accomplished theorist and a dedicated, effective activist. We  have much to learn from her example. However, to depict Addams as cleanly  radical, like depicting Richmond as conservative and classist but not explicitly  oppressive, is a partial view of history that invites unnuanced imaginings of  our own political positions today. Addams’s social workings were much more  inconsistent than the standard account allows. For example, Addams is often  celebrated in the standard account of social work as an active anti-racist.116 This  is true. However, at the same time as she was involved in important anti-racist  work, she also actively upheld racist hierarchies and injustices, however inadver tently. We (A.J. and Chris) wish to be clear that we aren’t positioning ourselves as  Copyright © 2019. University of Toronto Press. All rights reserved.
more consistently anti-racist than Addams. Our point isn’t that we should find  another flawless historical figure to emulate in our present-day anti-racism.  Rather, we’re challenging the belief that Addams is beyond reproach and that  any of us ever can be, in terms of the actual consequences of how we live our  lives. An important aspect of aligning ourselves with oppressed groups, espe 
cially those that we aren’t a part of, is recognizing that we’re implicated in the  very oppressions we oppose, which will sometimes shape the contours of our  concrete relationships and political activities. Anti-racist white people need to  accept that they not only benefit from the underlying white supremacist moral  exaltation that makes white privilege, entitlement, and violence possible,117 but  they also perpetrate white supremacy, however unwittingly.

actively attempt to live anti-racist commitments may sometimes do less harm  than some other white folks, but we’re not immune to enacting racism. We’re  therefore not seeking to displace Addams as the founder of radical social work  (at least not yet – in the next chapter we raise concerns about what it means for  her to occupy this position as a solitary figure). We’re rather suggesting that any  of our role models and positive examples need to be held in their complexity  so that this more nuanced view might make it easier for contemporary stu dents and practitioners to understand that we, too, are not immune to forces of  oppression simply by virtue of being against them. We can be as against them as  we like, but our opposition never accomplishes immunity from our active and  ongoing participation and complicity in those things we resist.118 
As previously mentioned, Addams suggested that identifying with the com mon lot is key to building democracy. Her proposal is a beautiful idea, and  social workers would do very well to identify further with service users, rather  than working so hard to differentiate “us” from “them.”119 No doubt a move  towards more neighbourly, respectful, and egalitarian relations across social  stratifications would be a radical shift from our individualistic and capitalist  mores today. 
However, according to Sherene Razack, when we work to identify with others  whose experiences and political positions differ from our own, “either to reach  each other across differences or to resist patriarchal and racist constructs, we  must overcome at least one difficulty: the difference in position between the  teller and the listener, between telling the tale and hearing it.”120 This insight  problematizes Addams’s advocacy that we attune ourselves to the experiences  of the common lot so that the work of social ethics or democracy can be clearly  laid out for us. Razack notes that such attuning involves those with greater  social and political power interpreting the lives of those with less social and  political power, and that different groups and individuals bring different expe riences into their interpretations. The same concern has been raised in relation  Copyright © 2019. University of Toronto Press. All rights reserved.
to Addams’s writing about poor people. Margolin suggests that Addams wrote  about poor people with an intended ruling class audience, which, he says, cre ated a differentiation “between viewers and viewed, subjects and objects.” At  times, he notes, Addams morally denigrated poor folks, depicting them without  an “understanding of their own activities or relationships.”121 
Relatedly, Addams suggested that we centre or privilege the knowledge and  stories of oppressed people, which is brilliant, radical, and necessary. However,  Razack notes that this strategy unfortunately but inevitably “falls apart …  [u]nless we want to fall into the trap of demanding that the oppressed speak  in a unified voice before we will believe them, [and so] we are still left with  the difficult task of negotiating our way through our various ways of knowing

and towards political action.”122 The “common lot” isn’t a singularity. There is a  great deal of disagreement within any community and, of course, also among the  demands and experiences that tend to be prioritized by different oppressed groups.  
Addams homogenized another diverse group while seconding the 1912 presi dential nomination of former US president Theodore Roosevelt.* She said, “It is  inevitable that such a party should appeal to women, should seek to draw upon the  great reservoir of their moral energy so long undesired and unutilized in practical  politics.”123 Roosevelt, however, was a capitalist and a eugenicist. His nomination  was likely not supported by many women, particularly poor, disabled, and racial ized women who had already been segregated, imprisoned, deported, exploited,  and/or sterilized under his former leadership. Addams’s articulation of “women”  here, like “the common lot,” functions to marginalize and even erase such diversity  within a category, even though she elsewhere critiqued this tendency. For example,  Addams critiqued ruling class women for their treatment of poor clients (includ ing female clients) and also for their treatment of female domestic workers who  cleaned their houses and cared for their children.124 Although these critiques were  grounded in her understanding that not all women experience the same singular  oppression, she elsewhere homogenized poor people and women.  
The Addams/Richmond polarization parallels the Malcolm X/Martin Luther  King Jr polarization of 1960s Black struggle or the W.E.B. Du Bois/Booker T.  Washington polarization of Black struggle in the Progressive Era. If these varied  polarizations map onto a consistent political spectrum, they portray Addams as  a radical and Booker T. Washington as a liberal. But this juxtaposition, in fact,  exposes that such polarizations are simplifications. Philip Kowalski suggests that  Addams’s exalted whiteness and class power enabled her to advocate individu alistic and moralizing liberal solutions to oppression without compromising her  reputation as a radical. He points out that Washington and Addams shared an  “insistence upon hygiene and order,” but Washington was criticized for this posi 
tion because he was lower class and Black. Kowalski writes that Addams and  Copyright © 2019. University of Toronto Press. All rights reserved.
other settlement workers were protected from this critique: their “association  with an immigrant underclass could never taint their white skins.”125 Norma Montesino notes too that Simon Patten, discussed earlier as aligned  with Addams, “related consumption to social changes.” Patten assumed that  “increased consumption would facilitate integration, but this potential would  be lost unless the authorities regulated the consumption patterns of the poor …  Thus, the poor had to be trained to develop new and appropriate patterns of

consumption.” Patten advocated for consumption educational initiatives for  poor people. He also endorsed Jane Addams’s call for organized leisure time  because, according to Montesino, “organised leisure time would facilitate access  for the poor to the ‘right’ activities including daily consumption.”126 Such assim 
ilative measures, aimed at integrating poor people into ruling class values and  mores, were critiqued by radical Black activists (and political allies of Addams)  W.E.B. Du Bois and Ida B. Wells when Booker T. Washington advocated them,127 
but Addams could advocate such measures without attracting critique. Addams’s own copy of Washington’s The Story of the Negro is on exhibit with other  selections from her personal library at the Jane Addams Hull-House Museum.  An insert inside the book reads: “Although W.E.B. Du Bois and Washington are  remembered as leaders with different methods for advancing civil rights, their  ideas intersected at Hull-House. Du Bois spoke at Hull-House and worked with  Addams with the NAACP. Booker T. Washington influenced Addams as well.”128 Addams also entertained Washington and his wife at Hull-House.129 Furthermore, settlement houses featured strong class boundaries, with poor  people often instructed by ruling class workers.130 In fact, many of the same  values and social mores that the COS imposed through friendly visiting were  also imposed on poor people in settlements. The persistence of classism, eth nocentrism, and racism in structures set up to work against class and ethnic  oppression relates to the concerns raised earlier about Addams’s philosophy.  Discussing Addams, Shannon Sullivan writes: “Countering asymmetries of top down power with horizontal processes of negotiation and deliberation does not  necessarily eliminate all forms of insidious hierarchy.”131 Inserting reciprocity  into existing stratification does not necessarily lead to a just democracy.* People  who accessed services and programs at Hull-House were likely generally treated  with more respect than many of those visited by friendly visitors and early case workers, but class divisions and capitalism remained in place, and the ruling  class workers benefited from the moral exaltation that has long come along with  Copyright © 2019.

acts of stratified “helping.”132 
Sullivan also notes that Addams maintained an “implicitly racist view of new  immigrants” alongside her “genuine attempt to combat white Chicagoans’ racist  dismissal of them.”133 That Addams actively worked against racism† and also

professed certain racist values and ideas tends to be omitted from the standard  account of Addams’s interventions into the social world. Addams wrote, for  example, of “immigrant revelation of social customs and inherited energy.”134 The inherent liveliness of immigrants was reiterated many times in her writing.  Sullivan therefore argues that for “the new immigrants described by Addams,  each side has something of value to give to the other, but they do not have equal  ontological weight as human beings. The civilized culture of the one group  makes them full persons, and the primitive culture of the other makes them  subpersons.”135 In line with ruling class white thinking at the time, Addams  “implicitly posited [immigrants] as being part of the untamed, energetic wil 
derness,”136 much like Indigenous people were popularly imagined. Holding  these groups in romantic nostalgia as offering something that “civilized” groups  have lost “both reflect[s] and support[s] a hierarchy in which white people are  seen as fully human and non-white people as less than so.”137 
It was presumably this romantic and ultimately racist nostalgia, along with the  desire to coordinate poor people’s leisure time (in alignment with Patten’s ideas  about reprogramming consumption patterns), that led to the use of “Indian  club” drills alongside German callisthenics and other activities in the gymna 
sium during the early years of Hull-House.138 The same nostalgia was likely also  the rationale for an Indian handicrafts club at Hull-House in the 1930s.139 These “Indian” activities were set up for recent immigrants and other poor  white Chicagoans, but there is no record of Addams or Hull-House engaging  at all with Indigenous communities in confronting colonialism during its first  half century in operation.* Edward Lee and Ilyan Ferrer note that social work,  including the settlement movement and the COS, “were transported from Brit ain, in order to further the Canadian and US colonial nation-building projects.”  They describe the “discursive absence” of Indigenous people within social work  as “a clear example of how social work professionals implicitly contributed to  the mythology of how white settler societies were constructed in Canada and  Copyright © 2019.

the US, while masking its origins in the dispossession and genocide of Indig enous peoples.”140 Hull-House was established on land from which Potawatomi  people had been forcibly displaced by the US government;141 it engaged in the  racist romanticization of Indigenous culture; and though it was founded on  principles of social justice, it did nothing to address injustices against Indig enous people. This absence is a significant gap, however common it remains.  Under the heading “Role of Social Work in Colonization,” Cyndy Baskin there fore cites Akua Benjamin’s “praise” of Jane Addams and her activism, but also

cites Benjamin’s anti-colonial critique of Addams’s lack of attention to colonial  violence: “However, let us not forget that while social movements were mobiliz ing in North America, whole populations were being decimated and systemati cally marginalized. Populations such as First Nations peoples faced genocide  during Jane Addams’s era.”142 
Furthermore, although Addams was actively involved in struggles against anti Black racism, in A New Conscience and an Ancient Evil she asserted that “the  negroes [were] making their first struggle towards a higher standard of domestic ity.”143 Here, the “higher standard” clearly refers to white ruling class social mores,  which exalts whiteness as superior to all those thus denigrated as primitive. This  statement is exactly the kind of articulation that might have brought scorn upon  Washington by radicals but went unremarked when Addams wrote it. 
In the same text, Addams also made a number of eugenic arguments. Lead ing eugenics efforts was just as central to the settlement movement as it was to  the COS. Addams wrote: 
When this new science [eugenics] makes clear to the public that those diseases  which are a direct outcome of the social evil [of sex work] are clearly responsible  for race deterioration, effective indignation may at last be aroused, both against the  preventable infant mortality for which these diseases are responsible, and against  the ghastly fact that the survivors among these afflicted children infect their con 
temporaries and hand on the evil heritage to another generation.144 
Addams also praised eugenicists for “publish[ing] an ever-increasing mass  of information as to that which constitutes the inheritance of well-born chil dren.”145 What’s more, the two leaders of eugenic criminology in the United  States, who worked to incarcerate women deemed feebleminded, defective, and,  later, psychopathic* for the duration of their childbearing years, were Josephine  Lowell and Katherine Davis† – both of whom were close friends of Addams and  Copyright © 2019.

* Rafter shows how the construct of “psychopathy” emerged from earlier eugenic notions of  inherent criminality, such as feeblemindedness and defective delinquency. 
† Banks defends Davis against such a framing, arguing that Davis believed in heredity and social causes of criminality. However, as discussed earlier, eugenicists were inconsistent in framing  genetics as the sole cause of things like criminality. Davis may well have tended towards the  
culturally determinist end of eugenic doctrine, but that doesn’t place her outside of eugen ics. What’s more, Banks’s apparent polarization of “progressive” versus “eugenicist” doesn’t  hold true to the historical record at all. Rafter documents Davis’s central role in incarcerat ing women on eugenic grounds while also recognizing social influences in criminality. With  
respect to Lowell, Rafter argues that eugenics has been downplayed or erased in accounts of her  life too, ignoring her important role as a leader in advancing eugenics-based practices.

worked with her in various social workings, including radical political strug gles. Thomas McCarthy points out: “With mutual interest in settlement work  as the start, Addams and Davis would develop a professional relationship of  mutual respect and social reform support.”146 One journalist even said: “If Jane  Addams were President [of the United States], Katharine Davis would be her  Vice President.”147 
Of this would-be VP to Addams, Nicole Rafter notes: “No Progres sive penologist had greater impact on eugenic criminology than Katherine  Bement Davis.”148 Davis was the superintendent of the Bedford Hills Refor matory for women, the first penal institution in the world that could hold  someone for life, their sentence based on what was believed to be permanent  degeneracy rather than on specific crimes they committed. Addams wrote an  endorsement for Bedford Hills to be built so that Davis could implement this  eugenic plan.149 
To prevent “unfit” persons from marrying, Addams called on governments  “to insist upon health certificates from the applicant for a marriage license, that  the health of future children might in a certain measure, be guaranteed,”150 and  she was involved in plans to institutionalize women who had been labelled as  feebleminded in order to keep them from having children.151 
Like the COS, which published The Tribe of Ishmael, the Hull-House– associated Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy also created eugenic  propaganda. Its 1911 “teaching aid” depicted a number of people who had  physical disabilities as well as “Dental Cripples,” “‘Drunken Mothers,’ ‘Early  Marriage,’ ‘Feeble-Mindedness,’ ‘Epileptics,’ and ‘Crippled Children.’”152 Mean while, the Hull-House–associated Girls’ Protective League went through Chi cago’s streets at night observing girls whose morals seemed questionable and  taking down their names and addresses for further investigation, after which  they could be involuntarily institutionalized.153 
Support of eugenics was not limited to Addams, Davis, and Lowell, but  Copyright © 2019. University of Toronto Press. All rights reserved.
was present throughout the settlement movement, just as it was throughout  the COS. For example, the Eugenics Record Office (ERO) was a data gath ering and surveillance body that worked to catalogue the “unfit” and pro mote eugenics. Two of its first field workers had been settlement workers,  and twenty-two ERO fieldworkers later became social workers.154 In many  ways, Addams and the settlement movement were radical and on the side  of social justice, but in other ways they weren’t. We don’t intend here to dis miss Addams’s significance, but rather to adjust what should be taken from  it. We can learn from her remarkable determination and struggle, and we can  also learn from her racism, classism, and disablism – like our own – without  excusing it.

52 Deconstructing Social Work and Social Work History 
A similarly simplistic picture of Mary Richmond allows her to represent con servative (but perhaps not explicitly oppressive) social work. As suggested pre viously, this depiction wasn’t how she understood herself and isn’t how many  others have understood her life and legacy. Like Addams, we are seeking neither  to demonize nor to romanticize Richmond. 
It’s clear that Richmond is classist; she calls poor people “less sophisti cated,”155 which resonates with Addams’s depiction of what immigrants have to  offer ruling class white society. However, Richmond also intervenes into clas sist discourse, critiquing the “conventional attitude toward the poor … without  being at any great pains to know them as they really are.”156 Similar to Addams’s  suggestions that we need to have a greater understanding of the lived realities  of poor people, but perhaps more in tune with Razack’s critique of discourses of  the common lot, Richmond writes that “any effort to go among [poor people]  for the purpose of helping them that does not frankly recognize [their] wide  diversity, must end in failure.”157 
Further, while later critical of Addams, Richmond wrote that she had “been  helped by” Addams, that Addams has “given us, at Hull House in Chicago, so  admirable an object lesson in the power of neighborliness.”158 Michelle Hébert  Boyd describes Richmond as believing it was important that social work shift  away from charity and into social justice, which would “make it easier to work  for social change while working to alleviate poverty.”159 This description fails  to represent the whole picture, but perhaps no more so than framings of Rich mond as simply opposed to social justice work. 
Furthermore, the people involved in more radical social work and the COS  were often the same people. Josephine Shaw Lowell, one Addams’s close allies  (through the radical Anti-Imperialist League and the National Consumers  League160) who led eugenic criminology, was also a COS leader. Her biogra 
pher writes: “Much has been made of the early competition and antagonism  between members of the COS and the settlement houses, but when the dust  Copyright © 2019. University of Toronto Press. All rights reserved.
settled down, it quickly became apparent that the two had more in common  than not.”161 Lowell was known for her “advocacy of settlement houses,”162 and  was also the “founder of the New York City Charity Organization Society.”163 In fact, Donna Franklin describes Lowell’s significant influence on Richmond’s  early development: the two women met in 1890 at the National Conference of  Charities and Corrections. “A social Darwinist organizer of the COS move 
ment, Lowell believed that poverty had its roots in the character of the poor.  Pauperism would be eliminated by educating and rehabilitating the poor”  rather than through relief.164 Given all these details, which are often left out of  (at least) more radical versions of the standard account, it seems unfair to place  Richmond on the conservative or “social control” extreme of social work, just

as it is simplistic to position Addams consistently on the social justice extreme –  especially when we intersect histories of eugenics into the standard account, as  previously discussed. Eugenics was embraced by liberal and radical social work  alike, even though it’s antithetical to social justice. Eugenic social work histories  are not included in the standard account of social work, as if they are not a part  of “social work history.” 
Contemporary Charity Organization and the  
Continued Polarity of the Riverbanks 
The standard account of social work is significant, not only to how we perceive  what social work was but also to what social work is and can be. Many of the  injustices from social work’s history continue into the present, however dif ferent they may appear. As discussed previously, our contemporary distancing  from the oppressions of the past helps facilitate this carry-over. Our present day reflexivity and self-interrogation is curbed if we cannot critically under stand that the past and our stories about the past create present-day taken-for granteds. The Addams/Richmond, radical/conservative, or community work/ casework divides that are commonly evoked in social work histories – whether  framed as complementary or conflicting – are politically and ethically inad equate. They allow today’s professional social workers to imagine themselves  aligned with Addams and radical social work, so that there’s no perceived need  to be reflexive of the ways in which their work causes harm and perpetuates  injustice. In short, the standard account of social work enables social workers  
to ignore how social work participates in injustice and oppression. Furthermore, to align radicalness with community work and conservative ness with casework creates a simplistic view of social change, people, and needs.  Richmond said that the individual and environment are interlocked and that  “the charity worker and the settlement worker have need of each other: nei Copyright © 2019. University of Toronto Press.

ther one can afford to ignore the experience of the other.”165 Of course, in spite  of saying this, Richmond focused on individual forms of assistance in ways  that were ultimately depoliticizing and victim blaming. Nevertheless, she rec ognized a need for both political and individual interventions, at least to some  extent and sometimes. As for the other side of the river, much of the work done  at Hull-House, discussed earlier, involved meeting concrete material needs;  Addams wasn’t only an activist and community organizer – she wasn’t opposed  to meeting individual needs for food, rent, and other essentials. 
Having complicated Richmond’s positioning somewhat, it nevertheless  remains that she was adamant friendly visitors “should not permit themselves to  be swept away by enthusiastic advocates of social reform from that safe middle

54 Deconstructing Social Work and Social Work History 
ground which recognizes that character is at the very centre of this complicated  problem.”166 Most contemporary social workers, and also many politicians and  policy makers, position themselves within this very particular liberal “safe mid dle ground.” The idea here is that a person can see both sides of a problem but  believe they need to find a middle ground between radical social change and  conserving the existing social order. The safe middle ground of liberal indi vidualism maintains that things should change – slowly – based on individual  efforts and traits, such as “character.” However, Bob Mullaly offers a helpful  analogy to illustrate how problems like unemployment are not best understood  as individual phenomena. We live in a society that has a certain unemployment  rate and a certain rate of poverty. As long as these two elements of society exist,  there will always be poor people and unemployed people. Mullaly compares  unemployment to the number of spaces available in a parking lot. As long as a  parking lot doesn’t have enough spaces to go around for all the cars, there will  always be cars without a space. It would be ridiculous to attribute this prob 
lem to their character, laziness, or ignorance, when there are structurally not  enough parking spaces. Until we end the existence of poverty on a structural  level, there will always be poor people, regardless of how hard they work and  other individual factors.167 Furthermore, individualistic approaches to social  reform don’t address social inequality – by which a disproportionate number of  people born poor, die poor; and a disproportionate number of people born well  off, die well off – or how these disproportionalities are raced, gendered, and so  on.168 Extending Mullaly’s parking lot analogy, we could say that some people  are born into our society with a reserved parking spot, and some are not. Yet,  from the security of an imagined “safe middle ground,” it makes perfect sense  for ruling class white women to tell poor women how to raise their families,  leaving the poor women to navigate intact oppressive systems in which they  remain disadvantaged. Such unjust liberal individualism is still the logic ani mating normative professional social work today.

The sentiment that escaping poverty is an individual’s responsibility remains  a recurring theme in contemporary social services. Many social workers give lip  service to political analysis – “claim[ing] Jane Addams as their source of inspi ration,” as Margolin puts it.169 However, when it comes down to it, services are  aimed at individuals. Sometimes social services even offer a narrative in which  individual intervention might somehow lead to “ending” homelessness, men’s  violence against women, and other political problems – like social conditions  improving through friendly visiting. From a liberal “safe middle ground,” those  who enact and benefit most from structural violence (white people, the ruling  classes) are never held accountable. Exalted groups’ responsibility, according to this  line of thinking, is to never give “indiscriminately,” as the COS said, but instead to

give intelligently and strategically to reputable charitable societies such as the  United Way. 
In fact, if the United Way seems to resonate so neatly with the historical Char ity Organization Society, it’s because the United Way is the Charity Organization  Society. The United Way traces its origins to the 1887 founding of the Denver  COS,170 drawing a direct line from the social work of the past to the present. 
The United Way works to raise funds and distribute them to local charities. It  determines which projects are worthy of funding. According to Bruce Levens, the  organization represents itself as ensuring that funding “allocation decisions are  community driven and are made by ‘citizen review panels’ drawn ‘from all walks  of life.’” However, decisions are actually made by experts and staff, “legitimized  by largely uninformed lay committees, and strategically chosen to attract dona 
tions.”171 Here again is the long-standing tradition of givers deciding what receiv ers need, fed by and contributing to the moral economy in which those in a posi tion to give are morally and otherwise assumed superior, so that any responsible  distribution of resources must be determined by them rather by than those most  in need. Addams’s suggestion that poor communities tend to operate within dif ferent and superior moral parameters invites a curiosity about how things might  
be different if local communities controlled their own redistributions. An example of the paternalism of the ruling classes towards poor and  oppressed people, which further exalts and benefits the former and denigrates  the latter, is the campaign “Change for the Better,” spearheaded by Downtown  BIZ – the Downtown Winnipeg Business Improvement Zone. Change for the  Better is an “anti-panhandling campaign encouraging Winnipeggers to refrain  from giving spare change to panhandlers, but instead to give to programs that  provide skills, training and employment.”172 The money raised by Change for  the Better goes to employment programs for homeless people.173 Again, the  focus is on individuals’ efforts to raise themselves out of poverty, without deal ing with systemic issues. One of the projects funded by the organization hires  Copyright © 2019. University of Toronto Press. All rights reserved.
people to “beautify” the downtown, which includes picking up garbage.174 So,  a downtown Winnipeg business organization created a campaign to reduce  panhandling by raising money for what homeless people really need – and it  gets its district “beautified” for free as a result. Who’s receiving something for  nothing here? 
The understanding in which being paid to pick up other people’s garbage is  preferable to panhandling is a value judgment based entirely on capitalist and rul ing class mores of behavioural regulation. There’s nothing intrinsically noble or  self-actualizing involved in picking up other people’s trash, and likely the business  owners behind this plan would object to being made to pick up others’ garbage  if they were to fall on hard times. We’re not saying there’s anything intrinsically

wrong with picking up trash either. But it’s normatively devalued in the moral  economy, and yet it is here imposed upon people as preferable to panhandling. This intervention into the social world is made possible by the assumptions  that the ruling classes have a better idea of what poor people need than poor  people do and that givers are able to give because of innate or at least persistent  superiority, rather than as a consequence of an unjust society. Poor people are  poor by their own fault, and following directions from ruling class people is  the way out of poverty. Firmly grounded in this moral economy, Change for  the Better tells people to donate to their program, because donors can trust  where the money goes “instead of giving it to panhandlers who may use the  money to buy alcohol, drugs or cigarettes.”175 Of course, if donors or organiz ers of Change for the Better choose to drink, smoke, or take drugs, nobody  questions their right to do so (at least within the confines of the law).* Some  people cultivate their culturedness and exaltation by drinking alcohol in the  right way, which may include drinking a lot of it. Others prove themselves infe rior by drinking. This ranked differentiation is the work of a moral economy  that actively functions to exalt some and denigrate others, and which under lies a common-sense acceptance of vast inequality and normalized day-to-day  oppression. 
Why should business improvement associations and social workers decide  what people need and how they should live their lives, while poor people are  only given a say when their narratives align with those of the rich?† 
The “where does the money go” concern expressed by Change for the Better  was central to the COS and continues unabated today, but the same scrutiny is  never applied to charities.176 If you give a dollar to a panhandler, that person has  a dollar. If you give a dollar to the United Way, the United Way takes around  15 per cent in administrative costs.‡ If that money were then given directly to

* In practice, though, the law enacts unequal moral regulation and material violence here too.  Homeless people, who don’t have living rooms, are criminalized for drinking in public, whereas  housed people have the privilege of drinking in private. Similarly, homeless people are much  more likely to be targeted by police for drug use because they don’t have private spaces to use  and are already subjected to intense police scrutiny. 
† Recipients’ stories are often used to support funding drives, but of course these stories are care fully selected and sometimes even edited by service providers and others involved in agencies’  public relations and image management.

Costa et al.

a poor person, the recipient would have about 85 cents. Yet, this transaction  rarely happens directly. If the money is passed on to a member agency, as with  most programming funding, that agency has administrative and fundraising  costs as well as social worker salaries, often concealed within programming  expenses. In other words, if you give a dollar to the United Way or Change  for the Better, administrators take a cut, social workers take a cut, fundraising  coordinators might take a cut, advertisers and printers might take a cut, and  the list continues. What is left over goes towards what is considered acceptable  needs for people who are deemed “deserving.” For example, from within the  “safe middle ground” – that always obscures structural barriers and emphasizes  individual effort – what’s left might fund a résumé-writing workshop, which  may be entirely irrelevant to many people struggling to eat three times a day  and secure a safe place to sleep. 
We aren’t saying that social service agencies are bad or shouldn’t be doing the  work they do – although that is surely the case for some. We are rather chal lenging the particular discourses that have been employed about poor people  since the beginnings of professional social work. These discourses are deeply  classed, raced, gendered, and so on; they are persistently critical of those who  access social services, but rarely of those who provide them; and, overall, they  work to uphold the status quo. 
When money given away is funnelled through an organization that adheres  to normative professional social work values,* it’s diverted from other organiza tions that might do concrete work to end injustice, as well as from those most  directly subjected to social injustices who might decide for themselves what  is most pressing in any given moment. Like any other people, a poor person’s  most pressing need might sometimes be a cigarette, a drink, or a hit. We should  be very careful about any sense of certainty that we know better and might not  make that same choice if we found ourselves in the same situation. We might  even make that same choice after a difficult meeting where we’re tasked with  Copyright © 2019. University of Toronto Press. All rights reserved.
deciding how to effectively use the charitable donations our agency has been  granted. Ever since the early COS, agencies that morally regulate poor people  have had a near monopoly on the kinds of social work that gets legitimized and  funded. 
However, rather than making the argument that community work and  political organizing is the only work that can lead to social change, we posit  that neither individual work nor community work are sufficient in isolation.  
* The concern here also applies to social work that is reliant on government funding.

An example of social working that defies the casework versus community  work dichotomy is the Ontario Coalition Against Poverty (OCAP), which A.J.  has worked with for over fifteen years. OCAP is a radical social justice organi zation that works primarily for housing for all and increased social assistance  rates in the short and medium term, and for the overthrow of capitalism,  colonialism, and oppression in the long term. As one component of its work,  OCAP uses individual casework as a form of radical community organiz ing. Very different from Richmond’s casework, OCAP mobilizes community  members to attend case actions for folks who need help, most commonly  with social assistance but sometimes with a landlord, boss, or other situation  involving immediate needs and a power imbalance between those involved.  A typical case action involves a group of people going to the person’s social  assistance or city councillor’s office and demanding a meeting with a supervi sor. The group is loud and essentially shuts the office down, refusing to leave  until a meeting is granted and the person gets what they’re entitled to.* OCAP  also hands out business cards to other people in the office so they know who  to call if they need help. This type of action is an effective form of individual  casework, and it also works to strengthen and empower communities at the  same time. 
John Clarke, one of OCAP’s founders, asserts: “Casework is a point of contact  with the community you are organizing. If you can’t show you can make a dif ference in people’s lives – you can’t expect them to join in to larger struggle.”177 Indeed, individuals are part of communities, and communities are made up of  individuals. But the individual/conservative versus community/radical dichot omy works to keep people from effectively engaging with both and exploring  how individual casework can be radical (just as group work or community work  can be conservative and/or oppressive, as discussed in the following section on  externally imposed community renewals and relocations). 
The ideology of the casework versus community work, or individual (and  Copyright © 2019. University of Toronto Press. All rights reserved.
family) versus community, dichotomy plagues European and white settler  colonial social work, but is not viewed in this way in non-Western forms of  social work.178 In cultures with distinct senses of personhood and connection,  including Indigenous cultures on Turtle Island, the individual/community  binary that much of Western social work views as a total impasse doesn’t make  any sense.179 
* Direct action casework is not specific to OCAP, but OCAP has been influential in its contem porary development and spread.

“Mingling” as Continued Solution to Structural Violence 
Many readers will have heard the infamous phrase “kill the Indian, save the  Copyright © 2019. University of Toronto Press. All rights reserved.
man” as a description of what Indian boarding schools were explicitly intended  to do. This violent articulation is from a paper called “The Advantages of Min gling Indians with Whites” by Captain Richard Henry Pratt. The “advantages”  Pratt puts forward are that white influence will assimilate or civilize Indigenous  peoples. According to Pratt, children’s Indigenousness would peter out through  their placement in white-run Indian boarding schools. This transformation  would happen precisely because they mingled with white people, the model for  being human to which they were forced to assimilate. This process was a highly  structured “mingling.” Indigenous kids weren’t going to school with white kids.  They were in racially segregated institutions where exclusively Indigenous chil 
dren were taught and disciplined by white adult authority figures.

60 Deconstructing Social Work and Social Work History 
Pratt’s “kill the Indian, save the man” is cited so frequently that the original is  sometimes not directly referenced. It’s therefore easy to read this phrase many  times without knowing where it was originally spoken. 
The first public reading and publication of Pratt’s paper was at the 1892  National Conference on Charities and Corrections,180 which later became the  National Conference of Social Work. To give some context, other featured  themes included immigration, the insane, the feebleminded, and women in  philanthropy. Of these themes, apart from “charity organization,” no other  theme had more than three papers devoted to it – although there was a special  tribute to influential eugenicist Oscar McCulloch, the COS leader discussed  earlier who wrote The Tribe of Ishmael181 and had recently died; four people paid  tribute to him. “Indian policy” had six papers devoted to it – twice as many as  any other theme apart from McCulloch’s tributes and charity organization.182 Several of these Indian policy papers focused on the education of Indigenous  children. 
To give a different kind of context, the National Conference on Charities  and Corrections directly became legitimized professional social work and is  consistently acknowledged as having done so in social work histories, however  selectively. Their 1892 program gives us a glimpse of what leaders of what was  soon called professional social work were up to at the time; yet, 1892 was also  the year that Black anti-lynching activist and social worker Ida B. Wells (dis 
cussed in chapter 2) published Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases,183 which is a very different kind of social working than that of McCulloch or Pratt.  We can just pause to consider what gets included or excluded in normative  social work history. 
While Pratt was not a social worker, it should be recalled that nobody had  ever called themselves or anyone else a social worker in 1892. The term didn’t  exist. However, the organization through which “social work” came into being  over the next decade considered Pratt one of their own. Pratt opened his paper  Copyright © 2019. University of Toronto Press.

by saying that he was specifically invited to speak, and his invitation “suggested  that the theme be ‘the Advantages of mingling Indians with Whites.’”184 Those  organizing the conference understood Pratt’s militaristic boarding school – the  first of its kind, but certainly not the last (as discussed in greater detail in chap 
ter 6) – to be among the kinds of interventions into the social world that they  advanced as an organized body.  
Charities and corrections were understood as so intimately connected that  they were named as the two major streams of interventions into the social world  that came together into professional social work. Furthermore, around a decade  before the term “social work” was coined, the people who were to become orga 
nized professional social workers invited Pratt to speak about his work creating

Indian boarding schools as they had become standardized. The invitation was  issued because the National Conference on Charities and Correction under stood Pratt’s work to be highly relevant to what they were up to themselves.  Another of the Indian policy papers, in fact, spelled out these connections: “The  Indian Policy in Its Relations to Crime and Pauperism” by Chairman Philip  C. Garrett. But it was Pratt, in front of those who would soon become pro fessional social workers, who first publicly advanced the idea that “mingling  Indians with whites” in a structured hierarchical institution would transform  Indigenous children for the better by “killing” their Indigenousness and making  them more like white people. 
The infamous quote from Pratt leaves out an ellipsis that should in fact be  there. But the entire paragraph is perhaps even worse than the often-cited and  infamous phrase: 
A great general has said that the only good Indian is a dead one … In a sense, I  agree with the sentiment, but only in this: that all the Indian there is in the race  should be dead. Kill the Indian in him, and save the man.185 
This violent articulation of an imagined moral imperative to ensure that “all  the Indian … should be dead” resonates, however distinctly, beyond colonial  violences and across professional social work interventions. After all, whether  through placing poor children in ruling class homes, ruling class friendly visi 
tors going to poor families’ homes, or ruling class settlement workers moving  into poor communities, the new professional social work attributed a transfor mational “advantage” or power to the “mingling” of classes. Furthermore, Jin  Haritaworn shows that this imagined classist and racist “advantage” continues  to frame gentrifications in which white queer activists displace working class  racialized folks from neighbourhoods where they’d previously lived. Harita worn notes that these activists imagine themselves to be revitalizing communi Copyright © 2019. University of Toronto Press. All rights reserved.
ties rather than destroying them.186 
Like these activists, professional social work continues to attribute a benefit  to stratified and targeted forms of “mingling.” This attitude is true of many indi vidualistic interventions, and it’s equally true of some community-level inter ventions, such as the externally imposed community destructions/relocations  of Africville and Regent Park. 
Albert Rose, who served as both director of the School of Social Work at  the University of Toronto and president of the Canadian Association of Social  Workers, is described in the Encyclopedia of Canadian Social Work as “the driv ing force behind the construction of Canada’s first major low-rent rehousing  project, Regent Park.”187

62 Deconstructing Social Work and Social Work History 
Regent Park was Canada’s first major social housing development. It was a  community-level intervention that aimed to mobilize what Pratt called “the  advantages of mingling.” Again, there is nothing intrinsically radical or non oppressive about community-level social work. Regent Park was designed to  replace what had, according to Ryan James, “long been labelled a criminogenic  ‘slum’ that, by its very existence, demeaned its predominantly white working class Anglophone residents.”188 Poor people were displaced from their prior  community and family structures, and only granted housing if they replicated  cisheteropatriarchal middle class norms: only nuclear families were granted  tenancy.189 Such heavy-handed and moralistic interventions into a commu nity’s organization affect all aspects of life, from caretaking and interdepen dency through neighbourly and reciprocal material, emotional support, and  ways of responding to violence or theft within a community to forms of sex,  love, and other affiliations that fall outside of those most normatively and con sistently socially sanctioned. There is no aspect of interlocking forms of oppres sion that is not involved in some way when outsiders destroy and reconstruct  a community.* 
Rose himself declared Regent Park a failure in 1968 (while the Africville relo cation was still underway).† He stated: “We have constructed huge villages of  the poor, disabled, and handicapped, vast collections of dependent and quasi dependent families … who cannot provide or foster the indigenous leadership  or, at least, the quantity and continuity of leadership required to build a strong  neighborhood.”190 Regent Park remained a poor neighbourhood for decades  and became increasingly racialized. 
Regent Park has been redeveloped again over the last few years. Before the  latest redevelopment, seventy languages were spoken in the community, and  two out of three residents had been born in another country.191 More than  three-quarters of the population of Regent Park were “visible minorities,” and  the second largest racial group in the neighbourhood was Black people, making  Copyright © 2019.

up nearly 20 per cent of the community’s population.192 Regent Park was not a  community that anybody would characterize as racially segregated or homog enous. However, “the advantages of mingling” factor into this story through  
* This assessment applies, too, to those soon to be displaced from Africville, discussed later in  this section, and to those displaced centuries earlier by capitalist industrialization in Europe,  discussed in chapter 3. 
† In response to these concerns, Rose advocated settlement house–inspired social work to  make positive interventions in poor urban communities. Again, settlement houses could be  mobilized to uphold normative values and reinforce the oppression and assimilation of morally  denigrated groups.

what Margolin calls the healing power of class.193 Regent Park was the poorest  neighbourhood in Toronto.194 
Significantly, with the most recent redevelopment, none of the long-denigrated  groups who’d previously peopled Regent Park were to increase in numbers.  Rather, as Martine August and Alan Walks write, “the one group to experi ence demographic growth [in the redeveloped community] will be English speaking adults aged 25-50 with household incomes over $60,000.”195 Again,  the advantages of mingling only go one way. Regent Park residents will be saved  from their own denigrations and ignorance through intermingling with ruling  class white folks; there are no imagined advantages to those already exalted in  the dominant framings of this mingling. However, the new ruling class Regent  Park residents’ esteem within the moral economy might increase when they put  aside normative ruling class prejudice in their seemingly brave, open-minded,  and charitable decision to live among poor people. Ruling class folks tend to  both frown upon classist prejudice and also to enact it. This normative gap  between what’s said and what’s done is perhaps what most distinguishes today’s  racism, classism, and other forms of oppression from those of previous eras,  when ruling class straight white folks’ prejudices were more openly, clearly, and  unapologetically articulated. 
Paving the way for the redevelopment, Regent Park residents were increas ingly constructed as criminalistic over the last few decades, feeding what James  calls “racist moral panics” about the neighbourhood.196 In 2002, the redevelop ment of Regent Park was first announced. Crime was a central justification  for levelling the community. The National Post asserted that “a 1980s and ’90s  crime plague too acute to ignore … forced the public and private sectors to  pay attention to Regent Park, so much so that the community is in the process  of a $1-billion redevelopment.”197 The dismantling of the neighbourhood was  discursively construed as both necessary and inevitable because of its social  problems. But rather than attending to the systemic causes of social and politi Copyright © 2019. University of Toronto Press. All rights reserved.
cal problems, and making obvious positive changes such as raising social assis tance and minimum wage rates and fixing the many outstanding repairs the  buildings needed, the only option presented was destruction and dislocation.*  The response to decades of systemic neglect and oppression doesn’t have to be  destroying a community. 
* Those who continue to live in Regent Park following its reconstruction may live in improved  material conditions. For example, some units have huge windows letting in sunlight to a degree  unheard of in the previous buildings, which many people experience as making a difference  in quality of life. As new buildings, they are also cleaner, better maintained, and easier to look  after than the previous units. However, such apparent “success” shouldn’t gloss over the fact

64 Deconstructing Social Work and Social Work History 
As for the officially stated justifications for the redevelopment, we might note  that the reduction of crime had been one of the reasons Rose gave for levelling  the previously existing “slum” and constructing Regent Park fifty years ear lier.198 This recurring argument suggests that the classism that conflates being  poor with violence and irresponsibility is as prevalent as it was fifty years ago. It  also suggests that little has been done over that time to make poor people’s lives  better so that crime might not present itself as such an obvious option when  all other avenues prove fruitless. Indeed, moral panics about increasing crime  often occur when there’s no increase or even a decrease in crime.199 The issue of  articulating the relationship between poverty and crime is all very complicated.  On the one hand, we need to recognize the violence of poverty in pushing peo 
ple towards dangerous and sometimes harmful behaviours to survive. On the  other hand, we need to be very careful that we’re not buying into the framing  of poor, racialized, and Indigenous communities as criminalistic. Across com munities, crime rates tend to rise when employment rates drop. Crime rates are  a thoroughly political problem. 
Crime is just one social problem related to poverty. Heather Bergen docu ments her conversations with Jessica and other young moms in Toronto. Jes sica describes how her childhood experiences would have been different if she  hadn’t grown up poor, which included that “her Mom wouldn’t have had to  steal to support them and subsequently would have spent less time in jail …  her Mom would have been less stressed and done drugs less … [and] her Mom  wouldn’t have let sketchy men hang around the house and so maybe Jessica  wouldn’t have been sexually abused.”200 Crime, sexual abuse, classist stigma,  hunger, forced familial separation due to jail time, having to pretend that things  were okay when they weren’t, the threat of state apprehension, and being unable  to concentrate in school: Jessica says that all these aspects of her childhood  would have been better if her mother had had more money. 
As Dorothy Roberts notes, “The vast majority of poor parents do not abuse  Copyright © 2019. University of Toronto Press. All rights reserved.
their children and there is no inherent psychological or cultural aspect of pov erty that makes people prone to abuse and neglect.”201 Yet, the vast majority of  
that it was decades of neglect, racism, and classism that made Regent Park what it was in terms  of the substandard material living conditions in the previously existing buildings. Rather than  considering the redevelopment a success, it should invite reflection upon what it means that  poor people’s living conditions were only improved so that ruling class people might consider  living there – and that this “mingling” of classes and races was the centrally intended interven tion into the lives of poor and racialized community members (rather than improving living  conditions as an end in itself).

children who are apprehended come from poor families.202 Jennifer Clarke dis cusses how Black social workers, and mothers and youth who are involved with  child protective services, all know that poor children tend to get apprehended,  often due to lack of affordable housing, childcare, and other basic needs.203 Cit ing Roberts, Clarke also notes: “Several studies have shown that doctors and  other mandated professionals diagnose poor children’s injuries more often as  abuse rather than accidents, as they do with children from more affluent fami lies.”204 But the solution offered isn’t usually to give poor people more money;  it’s to mingle them with wealthier people, through casework, relocations, or  life-skills classes taught by social workers. 
Mingling doesn’t improve poor people’s lives, and it might even make things  worse. According to research on the consequences of “relative poverty,” which  is the experience of having less than others in your social environment, many  difficulties in individuals’ and communities’ lives are tied to the local size of  the gap between rich and poor.205 Once basic needs are met, wealthier societies  are no better off than poorer ones in terms of the prevalence of a whole score  of social problems. However, societies with a smaller gap between their richest  and poorest members are considerably better off in relation to many different  social problems. Such findings suggest that further mingling of classes (rather  than redistributing wealth) might even increase problems such as gun violence,  infant mortality, high school dropout rates, and distrust of one another if min gling results in a more acute sense of unfairness and/or self-blaming shame on  the part of those who have less. According to these studies, reducing the gap  between rich and poor improves everybody’s quality of life, even that of the  wealthiest members. 
Nevertheless, as was the case both fifty and a hundred years ago, the preju dicial assumption that poor people are ignorant and need better examples set  for them by the ruling classes tends to dictate policy today, rather than real  poor peoples’ experiences (like Jessica’s) or relevant research like studies on the  Copyright © 2019.

effects of relative poverty. And so, paralleling Rose’s concerns about concentrat ing poor people in one area fifty years ago, the need to create mixed-income  neighbourhoods was used over the last fifteen years as a core reason to rede velop Regent Park once again.206 
According to August and Walker, the seemingly self-evident good of mixed income neighbourhoods rests on “the assumption that low-income people  benefit from having middle class ‘role models’ in their communities.”207 Yet,  as with early social work’s operationalizing of this concept in the form of  friendly visitors and casework, the assumption is deeply flawed and based  only on classism. As Paul Piff and colleagues report, “Despite experiencing  life stressors on a more chronic basis, lower class individuals appear to be

more engaged with the needs of others.”208 Low-income people are more likely  to be generous, charitable, trusting, and helpful than middle and upper class  people.209 Bergen writes that the poor young mothers she interviewed spoke  of “the strength, solidarity and community they experienced with other folks  that were poor.” For example, one of her research participants said, “[N]obody  understands what I’m going through more than another person that’s sitting  in the ghetto with me.” Bergen observes: “Other folks similarly discussed a  different set of values in poor communities, values that were grounded in an  ethic of care and mutual support. Paige explained this in terms of struggling  for money but giving money to people that ask for it on the street because, ‘We  need to help each other, it’s not just help yourself, you know?’” Another par ticipant, Louie, also described how poverty led to increased interdependency  with friends and family: “I really think people thrive when they’re intercon 
necting, but in a capitalist society, they’re like everybody is an individual, fend  for yourself … but it’s actually not … the way that we’re supposed to be doing  things.”210 Just as Addams documented in her 1902 critique of friendly visit ing,211 there’s a different moral sensibility among poor communities, which is  valuable if we can think outside of ruling class taken-for-granted moral deni grations of poor folks. Louie clearly states that capitalism and individualism  are at odds with interconnectedness and the thriving that comes with it. She  suggests that capitalist society has it wrong. What poor communities need  is more money and better infrastructural support. They don’t need training,  role models, or mingling. Again, the problem isn’t how poor and otherwise  oppressed groups live their lives; the problem is material inequality and struc tural violence, as well as the normative moral differentiations that make these  things appear acceptable.

ways of getting by without having enough to get by. They can thus make people’s  lives even harder. Furthermore, for all these same reasons, the disruption and  reconstruction of local social arrangements also undermines a community’s  capacity to organize and resist.212

themselves.* Nobody puts a billion dollars into redevelopment to expose  more rich people to poor people, or to expose more white people to people  of colour (although, again, Addams advocated such exposure in Democracy  and Social Ethics as a means to work against rampant inequalities). Rather,  the erroneous idea that poor and racialized communities are morally inferior  and ignorant continues to shape policy. Consequently, rather than alleviat 
ing the violences of poverty and racism, various schemes are put in place to  teach poor and racialized people to live more like the white ruling classes.  This strategy is both ineffective and profoundly offensive. 
Constance Backhouse writes of a “national mythology that Canada is not a  racist country, or at least less so than our southern neighbour.”214 As discussed  throughout this book, this self-exalting representation is untrue. For example,  social workers withheld material relief from residents of Africville after the  1917 Halifax Explosion, even though the Black community was located on  the waterfront of the harbour where the explosion took place and was as seri 
ously affected as some white communities that received relief.215 The explo sion, caused by the collision of a war munitions ship with another ship in the  city’s harbour, killed 2,000 people, wounded 6,000 more, and made thousands  homeless. Organized social work across the United States and Canada saw this  event as an opportunity to prove the importance of the new profession, and  social workers from the biggest cities in both countries came to Halifax to pro vide and organize relief. Half a century after these earlier social workers had  withheld relief from Africville residents following the explosion, social workers  centrally participated in the destruction of the community and the relocation  of its roughly 400 residents.216 
Many Canadians learn about Africville, a small, tightly knit and independent  community on the Halifax Harbour that was well established prior to World  War I.

relocated its residents. The standard account that gets told about Africville  implies that the demolition was part of a bygone era – from the time before the  civil rights and Black Power movements of the 1960s and ’70s.† This account is  absolutely false.

progress: white people articulated it as consistent with anti-racist movements  towards racial integration. 
The civil rights movement is commonly understood to have begun with Rosa  Parks’s refusal to give up her bus seat and the resultant Montgomery bus boycott  of 1956 (although individual and organized Black resistance had been taking  place long before that, as discussed in the next chapter).217 This event took place  thirteen years before Africville was destroyed and before the plan to do so was  officially set in motion. In the years following the Montgomery bus boycott,  several streams of Black activism fundamentally transformed the conscious ness and practices associated with anti-Black racism and white supremacy in  the United States and Canada. However problematically, most people know this  history as represented through the lives of two individual Black men: Martin  Luther King Jr and Malcolm X. Patriarchy, liberal individualism, and binary  thinking shape the story of two exceptional individual men representing oppos 
ing poles, as if this framing accurately accounts for the entire complexity and  diversity of anti-racist struggle at the time.218 But we can nevertheless take their  lives and work as points of reference, given that readers will likely have some  familiarity with them. For example, when we write that Martin Luther King Jr  delivered the “I Have a Dream” speech in 1963,219 we anticipate that many read 
ers will know of this speech and its enduring significance. That shared knowl edge will help to ground readers’ understanding of what we say from there.  The very next year several significant things happened in relation to anti-Black  racism and anti-racist struggle: King won the Nobel Peace Prize220 (showing  how well established his activism was by this time); Malcolm X completed the  Hajj to Mecca, delivered his speech “The Ballot or the Bullet,” and began to  distance himself from the Nation of Islam (NOI)221 (signifying that he’d already  done the majority of the significant interventions into the social world he’s most  widely remembered for as a member of the NOI); and the US Congress passed  the Civil Rights Act, which banned discrimination based on race.222 All these  Copyright © 2019.

things happened in 1964. But the year 1964 was also the year that the Africville  relocation began.223 It didn’t begin previous to civil rights struggle. By the time the last Africville resident had been removed from his home,  both King and Malcolm X had been assassinated.224 Therefore, every word  either one spoke that has ever been represented in a film, a song, a T-shirt, or  an email signature had already been spoken by the time Africville was finally  emptied of its residents and bulldozed. The demolition was not a relic of the  overtly racist pre–civil rights era. 
The Africville relocation was justified beforehand and considered a suc cess afterward as a movement away from racial segregation and towards  integration – by white liberals, not by Africville residents.225 Liberal whites

narrated Africville’s destruction as an anti-racist intervention into the social  world. The only reason we almost always imagine otherwise is due to what  Henri-Jacques Stiker calls “our prejudice of progress,”226 which we criti cally engage throughout this book and elaborate more fully in chapter 3.  According to this prejudice, that racist act surely was rationalized within  the context of a time we’ve long since left behind. But this supposition is  not true. Perhaps the Africville destruction could even be used to mark  the beginning of our current era of white supremacy,* which may be most  notable for the gap between what’s said and what’s done.227 Racism is almost  universally hailed as bad, and yet white supremacy continues to profoundly  shape everyday life.† That’s very different from the pre–civil rights era,  when white folks publicly and unapologetically articulated explicit racism.  In other words, it was within sensibilities that remain normative today – in  which racism is rampant but nearly always disavowed – that the Africville  destruction took place. 
Africville had been present on a prime piece of picturesque and potentially  lucrative waterfront land for over 150 years.228 It was an entirely Black commu nity, which was self-sufficient and characterized by a long tradition of neigh bour-to-neighbour mutual aid.229 However, Africville had no running water or  electricity because Halifax refused to service the community.230 The resulting  lack of running water and electricity fuelled the “slum” label long applied to the  community, which eventually was mobilized to justify its destruction. The rac ist withholding of services that made life easier and more comfortable, which  were almost universally available in white urban Canada by the 1960s, enabled  the moral denigration of the community. This denigration was further sup ported by the proximity of facilities that had a moral stain of dirt, disease, and  deviance – such as a prison, a garbage dump, and an infectious disease hospital.  Although these served all Halifax residents, the city located them near or within  Africville.231

In 1963 (again, the year King delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech), social  worker Albert Rose visited Africville for two hours and conducted consulta tions with Halifax residents. After his two-day visit, Rose wrote a report calling

for the destruction of Africville within six months. Rose stated that “a mod ern urban metropolis [cannot] tolerate within its midst a community … which  [is] physically removed and socially inadequate, not served with pure water  and sewage disposal facilities.”232 But his solution was not for Halifax to supply  these neglected services; it was to destroy the community.* Destruction wasn’t  inevitable. Rose wrote that “relocation and redevelopment” were necessary to  prevent “a condition of chronic dependency for many of the families under  study.”233 Through interlocking classist and racist denigrations, Africville resi 
dents were framed as a threat to the resources of the city† even though, for at  least fifty years, Africville residents had paid taxes but received considerably  less in return than the city’s other residents.234 
Many people in Africville were against relocation and the destruction of  their community. This resistance was contrary to Albert Rose’s account, which  claimed they were “ready and to some extent eager to negotiate a settlement  concerning the ultimate disposition of their community.”235 It wasn’t true that  people welcomed the relocation; many were adamantly opposed to it. The  relocations took place from 1964 to 1967, with the final holdout, “Pa” Carv 
ery, vacating his home in 1970. In 1967, during the time of active destruction,  Albert Rose was awarded the Canadian Centennial Medal.236 The entry about  Rose in the Encyclopedia of Canadian Social Work mentioned earlier doesn’t  discuss his important role in the Africville destruction. 
Much of the publicly stated rationale behind the destruction of Africville was  that racial segregation and “slums” could not be tolerated. In Razing Africville,  Jennifer Nelson writes: “Destruction can be looked on as a sort of rescue.”  She maintains that “investments in the inevitability of this solution [were] so  strong” that white people typically asked, “Why wouldn’t they just leave?” This  question, she points out, “relies on a learned arrogance that assumed the solu 
tion being offered – in this case, to live among white people – is superior, as  well as that the notion of free choice based on a common understanding of  Copyright © 2019. University of Toronto Press. All rights reserved.

A.J. visited the  museum in 2013, and the staff informed A.J. that they’d finally sorted out problems with the water  service to the land. The City of Halifax apologized to the community for its racist dismantling  of their homes, and, as part of the settlement, it returned the land for the museum. Ironically,  however, Halifax also refused to attach the church to its sewer system. 
† Thobani shows this same pattern in relation to immigration. Although the racist, morally  panicked, and commonplace discourse suggests that immigrants drain Canadian social ser vices, non-citizens pay taxes for services they can’t access.

making commonsense knowledge of the fact of its dependence and inevitable  need of an outside solution.”237 
Racial integration was framed as the solution to racism, with Africville and  with many other racially segregated communities in the United States and  Canada. But integration in itself does not solve racism. One Africville resident  described local white progressives who “held out integration like some kind of  Holy Grail, [and] we told them we weren’t sure exactly what integration could  do for us as a community.”238 Africville residents resisted relocation because,  although things were not perfect, people were doing all right. They wanted  change, but what they wanted was a more equitable redistribution of resources,  an end to racism, and access to services the rest of the city received – clean run ning water, sewage, and other amenities. 
Africville’s destruction is another event for which the underlying problem  can be framed as Black lives not mattering within the white imagination. The  lives and loves and homes and connections that a people cultivated over a cen tury and a half didn’t matter to the social workers,* city planners, and politi cians who destroyed it all, claiming to do so in the best interests of those whose  lives and connections they were destroying. In justifying the demolition, Hali fax Mayor John Edward Lloyd echoed a common justification for intrusive and  violent social work: “Sometimes, some people need to be shown that certain  things are not in their own best interests and not in the best interests of their  children.” He also asserted the importance of “well-trained social caseworkers”  in helping people adjust,239 suggesting he understood that the relocation would  be injurious to Africville residents and yet believing that this injury he was  causing was justified. 
Legally enforced racial segregation characterized by uneven qualities  of service and infrastructure is clearly a serious political problem, but the  racial homogeneity of a community isn’t necessarily a problem.

Yet, in spite of Rose’s involvement, other evidence of  social workers’ involvement, and what they acknowledge as an apparent endorsement of the  levelling of Africville in the Nova Scotia Association of Social Workers Newsletter, Jennisen and  Lundy describe the profession of social work as absent in the debate about Africville and in  other political struggles of the period. They frame Rose as an aberration in terms of the role of  social workers; we are suggesting, rather, that he was typical of social work across contexts –  not inactive at all, but actively implicated and involved.

rather than oppression,* some desegregation efforts were incompatible with  anti-racist demands for fundamental social transformation. In practice, deseg regation often interlocks with continued white supremacy. The same assimi lationist (liberal) white supremacist logic of “The Advantages of Mingling”  that informed Pratt’s prototype Indian industrial school persisted through the  1960s and well beyond, targeting Black, Indigenous, and other racialized com munities.240 In many desegregation efforts, white people set an example so that  racialized folks could more efficiently adopt white norms, values, and mores. 
In order to facilitate this intended project, when Africville was physically  destroyed, some of its existing family structures were purposefully destroyed  and re-engineered. During relocation, families were broken up: some were  forced to surrender children, while others were forced to marry to qualify for  housing. People found themselves living in “household structures that differed  from those they had known for generations.”241 This independent Black com 
munity was therefore not only relocated; white social workers and others recon structed it as a differently configured community, better aligned with the white  ruling class nuclear family. 
Such disruptive interventions into the structure and life of a community  would have displaced previously established and locally negotiated ways of  navigating and living outside the confines of white capitalist and cisheteropa triarchal norms, including the displacement of local navigations of compul sory cisheterosexuality, as well as locally specific arrangements of interdepen dence, mutual support, resource distribution, and care. Local practices of care  would have included diverse but internally sensible means of understanding  and responding to childhood, old age, the varied experiences laid claim to by  psychiatry, and other qualities and experiences under the umbrella of disability.  They would have included practices for responding to a family that couldn’t or  wouldn’t care for a child, an elderly relative, or any other person requiring assis tance. Local norms, mores, and practices would just as surely have included  Copyright © 2019. University of Toronto Press. All rights reserved.
ways of responding to theft, violence, and other such actions without calling the  police – who likely would have either not shown up or seriously hurt somebody  if they did. 
Communities have always had ways of responding to these widely varied  things – which isn’t to say that such practices are always perfect, effective, or  fair. As Connie Burk points out, community practices and values “may have  been flawed or aspirational.”242 Nevertheless, communities develop ways of

doing and living and thinking and feeling; they negotiate these practices with  one another over time; and such community-specific and historically rooted  ways of living everyday life, however imperfect, may no longer work as well or  come as naturally when people are uprooted and moved to a different location  and forced into different social and familial structures. The concrete strategies  developed to navigate local norms, discourses, and power relations don’t trans 
late perfectly to new contexts. We can assume that, over the course of Africville’s  history, there were instances of the varied things referred to today under the  umbrella categories of queerness, disability, and crime within the community,  just like there would be some of these experiences in practically any commu 
nity during any 150-year stretch. Local ways of engaging and negotiating these  things are disrupted when outsiders tear apart social and familial structures and  cobble them back together in new and unfamiliar formations. 
In this chapter and the next, we discuss historical details and figures left out  of the standard account detailing the emergence of professional social work.  Before moving on from our discussion of the Africville relocation, as it relates  to Black anti-racist struggles of the mid-twentieth century, we’ll offer a few  thoughts on the interlocking oppressions in the moral economies of what could  be called the standard account of the civil rights movement. 
As mentioned earlier, Rosa Parks’s refusal to give up her seat to a white person  on a bus is said to have sparked the civil rights movement by igniting the Mont gomery bus boycott. However, many details of this event are not what they’re  commonly imagined to be. For one thing, Parks was a trained community orga nizer and a paid employee of the National Association for the Advancement  of Colored People (NAACP). She was not the tired old woman who is usually  brought to mind in recollections of this incident. Her refusal was a political act  of civil disobedience, planned and staged by the NAACP. Furthermore, her cel ebration for igniting the civil rights movement is accomplished at the expense  of someone even more relatively denigrated in interlocking moral economies.  Copyright © 2019. University of Toronto Press. All rights reserved.
A fifteen-year-old Black girl named Claudette Colvin refused to give her seat  to a white woman in Montgomery nine months before Rosa Parks did so.243 The NAACP chose Parks to re-stage what they knew Colvin had done, with the  explicit aim of inciting a bus boycott to protest segregation. Parks was imagined  more likely to evoke white sympathies than Colvin, due to the NAACP’s under standing of the moral economies of the day in which ageism, colourism, and  moralization about sex outside of marriage all interlocked with anti-Black rac ism. Colvin was darker skinned than Parks, and she became pregnant shortly  after her arrest, giving birth the month Parks was arrested. Colvin was there fore pregnant through the planning of Parks’s re-staging of Colvin’s refusal.  The NAACP didn’t feel that Colvin, as a darker-skinned pregnant teenager,

74 Deconstructing Social Work and Social Work History 
was the right person to symbolically galvanize a mass movement against racial  segregation.244 
Perhaps of particular interest to many contemporary social workers, Col vin was sexually active and unmarried when she refused to give up her seat.  After becoming a teenage mom, she went on to become one of four women  plaintiffs in Browder v. Galye, which successfully ended legal racial segregation  in Alabama.245 Therefore, one of the most significant US political transforma tions in the past century was significantly sparked by a fifteen-year-old Black  girl who was sexually active and became a teenage mom. This fact flies in the  face of the most freely circulated ideas about teenage moms and other sexually  active teens. We therefore invite folks to keep the history of Claudette Colvin in  mind the next time they find themselves in a conversation or relationship with  a Black teenage mom or a teen said to be sexually “promiscuous,” “precocious,”  or whatever. All the assumptions that come with adult and professional char acterizations of sexually active teens would never predict that a sexually active  Black teenager would have played such a key role in fundamentally changing  the world that we live in today. Racism and white supremacy might very well  have continued to look very different, to this day, had it not been for Claudette  Colvin. 
Yet, as important as Colvin is to this history, she also wasn’t the first person  to do something like what she did. A decade before Colvin and Parks wouldn’t  move from their seats in Alabama, for example, Viola Desmond, “often referred  to as Canada’s Rosa Parks, was jailed and eventually fined after sitting in a sec 
tion reserved for whites in the Roseland,” a movie theatre in New Glasgow,  Nova Scotia.246 
However, as Angela Davis reminds us in her analysis of the Montgomery  bus boycotts, we shouldn’t remember these histories through the lens of indi vidualism.247 Bus boycotts could have been mobilized around Colvin’s arrest;  something on that scale could perhaps have been spurred by Desmond’s arrest;  Copyright © 2019.

and there are many acts of resistance equally brave as that of Parks, Desmond,  or Colvin. In the following chapter, which describes the erasure of Black social  workers from white social work history, we mention several resonant exam ples: Ida B. Wells took a similar action in 1884 in response to racial segregation  on trains and won her case,248 which first established her as an activist; and  Maggie Walker and the Independent Order of St Luke led a streetcar boycott  against racial segregation in 1903.249 It took many efforts such as these, and the  coordinated mass collective response of many more folks, whom Davis evoca 
tively describes as “ordinary people like you and me,” to amass the movement  to end racial segregation.250 Like all social justice movements, the Montgomery  bus boycott was built on painstaking organizing efforts and the infrastructure

developed through these efforts by generations of people struggling for social  justice. The bus boycott wasn’t a spontaneous explosion. The circumstances for  it to take place, including the gradual building of community education and  resources, were carefully planned, which included planning the eventual spark  for the movement: Parks re-staging what Colvin had recently done. 
Conclusion 
A truly critical and anti-oppressive social work would need to engage with its  historical legacies. Simply scratching the surface of social work reveals many of  the oppressive values that persist. This legacy is commonly acknowledged in  critical and anti-oppressive social work literature, but often in a way that invites  the “other side of the river” positioning of oneself as exempt from the critique  one makes. The standard account works to construct social work history as  emerging out of two distinct branches: one radical and the other conservative.  This account – according to which Richmond and the COS worked towards  social control, while Addams and the settlement movement worked towards  social justice – is partial and doesn’t serve us well today. It casts “radical” social  work as innocent, erasing its complicity in colonialism, classism, racism, and  eugenics. This history allows present-day social workers to imagine themselves  firmly on the side of social justice without having to examine how oppressive  and complex historical legacies, alongside contemporary discursive and struc tural factors, shape their everyday efforts. A fuller account of social work’s his tory needs to contend with the cohesive work that both branches of the new  social work undertook to lead eugenics policies and practices; with the way  in which the “mingling” of races and classes was used to attempt to assimilate  diverse people to become more like the white ruling classes; and with the fact  that community-level social work efforts can be as oppressive as even the worst  individualistic casework, whereas casework can be carried out in a way that’s  Copyright © 2019.

politically aligned with radical political critique. As we explore further in the  next chapter, a fuller account also needs to contend with social work histories  outside of white social work histories.

White Supremacy and the Erasure of Racialized Social Workers Social Work History as White Social Work History This chapter furthers the question, began in the last chapter, of what and who gets left out of the standard account. Here we focus primarily on “the color-line,” a phrase made famous by Black activist-scholar W.E.B Du Bois at the same time as the term “social work” was coined.1 We focus on the work the colour line continues to do since his time in its framing of the Progressive Era. We reflect upon who gets credited for making history and how this choice maps onto moral economies that separate who is and isn’t a valued human with something to offer our social world. In contrast to the histories most circulated, at the time the term “social work” was coined, community initiatives and innovations in working with disadvantaged groups as well as efforts to transform political structures were taking place all over the world. Many of the people involved in these diverse interventions into the social world were neither Christian nor secular, and many weren’t white. For example, according to Saba Mahmood, Zaynab al-Ghazali “is credited with establishing a women’s organization [in Egypt] called the Society of Muslim Ladies … which was initially dedicated to providing charitable services to poor women and children” and later expanded to work towards structural change in collaboration with the Muslim Brotherhood.2 The Society of Muslim Ladies was established in the 1930s, and it might be imagined that al-Ghazali’s efforts were made possible due to feminist successes in Europe and white settler colonies like Canada and the United States. However, Mahmood shows that al-Ghazali’s interventions into the social world were “a product of the sociopolitical ethos of her times and the new possibilities that were opening up for women at the turn of the twentieth century [in Egypt itself]. Al-Ghazali reached adulthood when there had already been almost three decades of women’s activism in Egypt.”3 There was also a proliferation of women’s publications around 1900 that “was accompanied by an efflorescence of women’s charitable associations, which served as the springboard for women’s entry into public and political life.”4 This Egyptian timeline is concurrent to, and squarely resonant with, first wave feminism in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom, as well as the rise of women’s central role in providing charity that accompanied feminist movements in the Global North. In Europe and white settler colonies, histories of feminism and social work tend to be mapped onto stories of progress, which are framed as a movement away from religion and towards secularism (whether or not that fits with historical figures’ understandings). Indeed, as Sherene Razack observes, “the secular/religious divide . . . functions as a color line, marking the difference between the modern, enlightened West, and people of color, notably Muslims.”5 This blueprint for historical progress doesn’t map well onto developments in Egypt – and not because secularism was unavailable as an option. “Zaynab al-Ghazali’s first exposure to women’s activism came at the age of sixteen when she joined the Egyptian Feminist Union (EFU), an affiliation that she reportedly later terminated because of the EFU’s ‘secular orientation.’”6 In reading about al-Ghazali’s treatment of gender relations, it may be easy for many white readers to imagine that secular feminism is a better path towards justice. For example, “the language of ‘women’s rights’ finds an important … place in al-Ghazali’s speeches and writings and is often invoked to emphasize that Muslim women and men are equally called upon to serve God,”7 a priority that may seem misaligned to a secular reader. However, Mahmood demonstrates the profound changes that al-Ghazali and Islamic women’s movements have had on gender relations in Egypt. In her conclusion, she challenges readers with the spectre of genocide, which she suggests is implicit in secular framings of non-secular ways of being: she invites her readers to consider “that analysis as a mode of conversation [across difference], rather than mastery, can yield a vision of coexistence that does not require making other lifeworlds extinct or provisional.”8 Is it possible for secular white readers in the Global North to imagine that Muslim Egyptian navigations of gender relations are just as legitimate and potentially transformative as those that are valued within secular feminism? Furthermore, what would it mean to take seriously Mahmood’s challenge that we tend to approach difference as something we implicitly aim to make “extinct?” Histories like al-Ghazali’s are left out of the standard account of social work, which traces white US settlement houses and Charity Organization Society initiatives back to white people’s initiatives in the United Kingdom.9 This chapter offers a small corrective to this tendency. We do not, however, claim to offer a complete account of the story of racialized peoples’ contributions to what has come to be called social work. There will always be examples left out, and our account is no exception. However, by foregrounding and naming these exclusions, and by making humble correctives to a few such exclusions, we hope to offer a context for thinking further about the kinds of interventions into the social world that are normally left out of social work history. We aim to show that these exclusions are arbitrary, in the sense of being unjustifiable; yet, at the same time, they are logically coherent within the framework of white supremacy and have real effects on people’s lives and possibilities. They are arbitrary because there is no objective reason to privilege white people’s accomplishments and to leave out those of racialized communities; but they are perfectly sensible and coherent within the moral economy of white supremacy. White supremacy shapes both the inclusions and the exclusions of the standard account of social work’s origin. In response to these exclusions, this chapter highlights some innovations, contributions, and legacies that racialized communities have made, focusing on Black communities in the United States and Canada. The standard account of social work is simply a white account of white social work.* It ignores racialized peoples’ contributions to the mishmash of interventions into our social world that has been called social work for over a century, and thus constructs social work as white in both the past and the present. The few historical figures we name, alongside countless Black anti-slavery and anti-lynching advocates, community organizers, settlement workers, and other activists and charity workers, were active in forging the foundation of modern social work. Yet, it’s only recently that early Black social workers like Ida B. Wells, Mary Ann Shadd Cary, Mary Church Terrell, Reverdy Ransom, and Maggie Walker are having their histories told or read in contexts where there aren’t exclusively Black students, and where these historical figures are understood to be the originators of social work (as opposed to only the originators of Black social work) that they really were. If we understand social work to include various forms of relief initiatives, as well as diverse actions aiming towards community and large-scale political and social transformation – as with the range of work done at Hull-House or by al-Ghazali and the Society of Muslim Ladies – then the distinction between what does and does not get officially designated as social work becomes increasingly arbitrary and unjustifiable. As Linda Gordon asserts, “Welfare histories [have] been by definition white-centered.”10 She shows that it’s “possible to make the widespread welfare reform activity of minority women visible only by changing the definition of the topic and its periodization.”11 Likewise, such a move shifts the understanding of the entirety of social work history. Because social workers are assumed to be white, social work within communities of colour – including that which inspired later white social workers – gets almost entirely left out. Before recounting the histories themselves, we might reflect: considering the explicit anti-Black racism and violence that was widespread in Canada and the United States at the time of social work’s nominal emergence, what kinds of efforts would have made sense for Black social workers? This chapter highlights a few stories of people who were engaged in certain kinds of social welfare activity that have not been officially acknowledged as such within histories of social welfare. Histories such as these are frequently dismissed as particular to specific populations. When white people worked with other white people, the particularity wasn’t noted – whiteness as particularity went unremarked. But Black social work, when discussed at all, tends to be told as Black history rather than part of a collective history. White history is told as a shared history, whereas Black, Indigenous, and racialized histories are normally deemed relevant only to their respective communities. But, considering the social and political context, it made sense for Black social workers to focus on interventions relating specifically to Black communities.* The reasons for this focus include racism, a sense of connection to those communities, a feeling of solidarity with the struggles their own neighbours were experiencing, and the recognition that their neighbours were struggling distinctly, and often more intensely, than white people living nearby (due to racial segregation and the uneven distribution of resources that has always accompanied it in practice12). Black social work was no more particular or insular than work being done within white communities. Yet Black social work, and its contributions to the world we live in, continues to be largely unacknowledged by white recorders of history, which of course includes white recorders of social work history. When white social work was first emerging, a strong and diverse tradition of Black social work was also emerging. Jane Addams is championed as the founder of radical social work, and her anti-racism is used as a prime example of how she lived her political commitments. At the same time (and earlier), however, there were massive organizing efforts on the part of Black people who were pivotal in founding radical social work. If we relieve Addams of some of the responsibility for carrying the entire tradition of social justice–oriented social work practice, we can look to other historical figures and social work movements to see that alternative approaches to helping have always existed – including among professional social workers. Iris Carlton-LaNey points out that when social work was laying down its roots in white America, Black people were developing a “parallel social welfare system.”13 Because of racist segregation policies, many Black people could not access white social welfare programs, and Black service providers were not welcome in the majority of white organizations. In this context, Black communities’ efforts focused on what at the time was referred to as “racial uplift,” and a number of originators of Black social work believed that Black people should deliver services for Black people. Ida B. Wells, for instance, wrote: “The Afro-American can do for himself what no one else can do for him.”14 Black communities organized benefit programs, schools, adult education initiatives, community centres, healthcare clinics, homeless shelters, settlement houses, seniors’ homes, youth programs, parenting education, daycares, kindergartens, recreation programs, job banks, clothing banks, ice banks, food banks, and bank banks. And yet, white people providing these types of services to white people at this time is what is called the origin of social work. Therefore, we can ask: Who gets to tell history? Who are its imagined and actual audiences? Who gets cast as the protagonists or primary characters in the stories that are told, and how does this choice affect the take-up of these stories among diverse audiences? Who benefits from these histories being told in the ways that they’re told? And what role do these versions of history have in furthering the moral economies that continue to accumulate moral worth for white subjects and denigrate the imagined value of people of colour? Black Churches: Bestowing Charity and Organizing for Change There are limitless forms by which people help one another. However, resonating with Egyptian developments at this time, two of the key sites in which help became organized and formalized in Black communities were churches (especially those associated with the social gospel movement) and women’s clubs (which were either secular or attached to a religious institution). The church therefore played a key role in the development of Black social work. In white social work, “social work tended to fill spaces left by the reduced role of religion in everyday life,”15 but organized religion played a more central role in Black social work. This situation arose not only because of the role that organized religion played in the development of charity and aid, which also heavily influenced white social work, but also for reasons particular to Black communities. In many Black communities, churches were the only available community spaces. In many places in the United States, it was illegal for Black people to congregate in groups of more than

University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division. Edição do Kindle. five people other than at church, which meant that organizing was criminalized outside of the church. According to Carter G. Woodson, a prominent Black intellectual at the time, churches were “the only institution in which [Black people could] freely exercise authority”16 and pursue strategies of self-determination and self-governance.* As a result of these factors, churches were important spaces for community organizing, and they ran numerous social and political programs alongside their more traditional role of providing relief to poor people.17 Some Black people, however, were critical of the role of organized religion. W.E.B. Du Bois, for example, disparaged Black churches for not doing enough to help Black communities. In 1912, he wrote in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) publication The Crisis that the church was “still building churches when people need homes and schools, and persisting in crucifying critics rather than realizing the handwriting on the wall.”18 At the same time, he recognized the importance of churches and their centrality in Black communities.19 In the conclusion to an extensive study he led on the Black church, Du Bois, with Mary Church Tyrell and Kelly Miller, recognized the significance of the church as “a mighty social power,” but also asserted “it needs cleansing; reviving and inspiring.”20 One of the key influences of social work and the helping professions in Canada and the United States was the social gospel movement.21 Social gospel originated as a reaction to the social and economic devastation that industrial capitalism caused and the absence of an appropriate response from conventional Christianity.22 Made up of radical and progressive Protestants, the movement engaged in a variety of social welfare programs. Many social change–oriented churches throughout the United States implemented important social programs.23 The Institutional Church in Chicago, under the leadership of Black Reverend Reverdy C. Ransom, is one example of the social gospel movement in action. Ransom and his congregation built a settlement house that opened in 1900 and was designed to cater to the needs of the Black community.24 Ransom was a radical, encouraging people to think about adopting socialism, which he saw as a solution to racism.25 He also worked to help settle conflicts between white strikers and Black strikebreakers in Chicago.26 Resonantly, Woodson describes how a Congregational church in Massachusetts under the leadership of W.N. DeBerry established “a free employment bureau, a women’s welfare league, a night school of domestic training, a girls’ and a boys’ club emphasizing the handicrafts, music, and athletics.”27 Similar programs existed in progressive Black churches across the United States and Canada.28 The social gospel movement worked in both white and Black communities to deal with the material crises that people experienced. In addition to increasing people’s access to education, childcare, settlement houses, homeless shelters, and other social services,29 the social gospel movement also worked towards large-scale political change.* Carter G. Woodson, known as the “Father of Black History,”30 referred to the work of social gospellers as “social work” in The History of the Negro Church in 1921. “Separate Spheres” and Women’s Clubs Following the social disruptions caused in Europe and white settler spaces by capitalist industrialization and urbanization, a new discourse of gendered mores, norms, and values emerged. This new arrangement, referred to as “separate spheres,” was a system which held that respectable men and women should only occupy roles then considered gender appropriate. The resultant separation between men and women was helpful in creating possibilities for love-based companionships among ruling class women at the time, known as “Boston marriages” (which we discuss in the next chapter).31 It was oppressive in many other ways, however, and it furthered the moral economy of differentiated human value – valuing the supposedly men’s sphere over the women’s sphere. According to separate spheres discourse and mores, the public domain (politics, paid work, and so on) was to be peopled exclusively by men, and the private domain (household and family) was to be exclusively women’s domain.32 These supposedly “traditional” ideas have a much more recent history than we tend to think. Previously in Europe, although gender roles were segregated, local community norms and immediate family needs largely governed how, where, and with whom people spent their time. The home had often been the location of economic activity, whether for farming or cottage industries, and men and women, boys and girls would often work alongside one another on many day-to-day tasks. The notion that men should work for pay and women should tend to the home and care for the family was at best inconsistently followed, and there was no sense that it was morally superior to always segregate genders. In response to the moral panic arising due to the increased personal freedom that resulted from capitalist industrialization and urbanization, separate spheres discourse arose to police interactions between men and women. It was essentially a moral discourse. In order to demonstrate oneself as respectable, a person would only ever labour in ways then considered gender appropriate. Alongside shifting the norms and mores within ruling class culture itself, this change enabled yet another way for poor and racialized people, especially women, to be looked down upon as morally inferior: female slaves and poor women of any race could not abstain from the “public” or “men’s sphere” of labouring for others. Poor women worked outside of their homes to survive,33 and, obviously, slaves could not freely choose how to direct their labour. Thus, ruling class women’s respectability and morality increasingly relied upon differentiating themselves from women who cooked, cleaned, and provided care in other people’s homes and were considered inferior for doing so.34 Relatively well-off Black women, before and after emancipation, often demonstrated their respectability and full humanity by adhering to the dominant social mores of separate spheres. Black communities frequently adopted all or part of separate spheres norms and discourse. Of Black Nova Scotians, for example, Suzanne Morton writes: “Gender ideology that placed women in the home offered protection and dignity within their own community, even if it could not secure recognition from the white middle class.”35 Harley explains the adherence to separate spheres norms in the context of the post-emancipation US South: “Gender-defined work and domestic responsibilities were symbolic of their new status.” He argues that, within a white supremacist and patriarchal society, “sex-segregation helped to protect black women, married or single, from charges of immorality such as those made by nineteenth- and twentieth-century writers and reformers.”36 The performance of separate spheres allowed select Black people to establish membership in the new middle class, which Marie Louise Fellows and Sherene Razack describe as gaining “a toehold on respectability.”37 Although white supremacy and patriarchy continued to shape and define their lives and possibilities, some Black women were able to accumulate the social markers of the bourgeois class (certain kinds of dress and education, avoiding labour considered unbecoming for a lady, and so on) through which they precariously entered the ranks of the middle class. As in white communities, separate spheres mores intersected with the rise of the middle class professions, which shaped selective opportunities for women to enter the public sphere – but only in roles related to the direction and surveillance of the private sphere. Women occupied paid positions in nursing, childhood education, and social welfare activities, but only rarely in more squarely male-gendered professions such as law or medicine. In Black communities, the transition to women occupying leadership roles within the female-gendered spheres seems to have been smoother than in white communities. For instance, Shirley Yee writes: “Black women often worked with Black men in building institutions that were critical to daily life. Black women’s involvement in the establishment of churches, schools, and mutual aid societies reflected a long legacy of cooperation between Black men and women.” She shows how “Black Canadian women continually blurred the line between public and private and tailored their own notions of ‘true’ womanhood to the realities they faced in daily life.”38 In both Canada and the United States, according to Yee, “the adoption of patriarchal structures that ironically symbolized freedom also illustrated the pervasiveness of sex role ideology.” However, this ideology was resisted too – or at least it was navigated in ways that seem to have been unique to Black communities: “Through their public activism, Black women maintained the interconnectedness of family and community, the private and the public – between which there was little distinction” in their real lives.39 Their ability to interconnect may have been because Black women had always worked in the “public sphere,” and these social mores were only newly available to them; and it may have also reflected distinct (and surely internally diverse) gender mores and norms that had been brought over from West Africa and were preserved through slavery.40 During this time, women’s clubs were one public forum for women to engage in the social governance of the private realm, discussing and acting on issues that were deemed gender-role appropriate. The 1890s saw a wave of clubs emerge in the United States that were focused not only on the home, but also on social and political reform.41 In this decade alone, clubs emerged in New York, Boston, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Jefferson City, Omaha, New Orleans, Knoxville, and Providence – and likely in smaller communities as well.42 In 1896, the National Association of Colored Women was founded by activists including Ida B. Wells-Barnett, Mary Church Terrell, Francis Harper, and Harriet Tubman, bringing Black women’s clubs from across the country into a coalition.43 Women’s clubs of this era were largely focused on individual and community betterment, which they called racial uplift.44 Clubs also served as a training ground for women to obtain community work and social service skills.45 With some important exceptions, these clubs were run by middle and upper class Black women, who could follow separate spheres mores for women46 and often had a college education.47 Women’s clubs typically espoused domestic feminism, which, according to Nancy Cott, is “women’s assertion of private power (particularly reproductive control) within their families.”48 Club women, according to Anne Meis Knupfer, “perceived their roles of mother, wife, and homemaker as cornerstones to ‘race uplift’ and progress.”49 They founded orphanages, settlement houses, youth clubs, kindergartens, women’s education opportunities, employment services, youth/recreational programs, nursing homes, daycares, and at least one YWCA.50 Notably, these programs were all in keeping with the ideologies of domestic feminism and separate spheres. Club women helped establish many important social services and worked towards strengthening the Black community, always in keeping with those arenas of life in which it was normatively deemed appropriate for women to participate. The social and political effects of the work of Black women’s clubs, like the concrete effects of Addams’s and Richmond’s work, were therefore complicated. They provided crucial programs and resources to communities that were usually excluded from white social work services, but they also acted to police morality and gender roles. Women’s clubs worked towards reform and progress, but they also confined social service providers and recipients alike to gender roles deemed appropriate according to classed and racialized social mores.* The Great Migration: Migrant Assistance and the Shift towards Black Incarceration The “Great Migration” began around 1915 and, according to Isabel Wilkerson, was “a statistically measurable demographic phenomenon marked by unabated outflows of black émigrés” to Northern US states.51 In order to support the many people who were arriving in cities in the North, often incredibly poor and in need of assistance, Black people set up a number of welfare programs.52 One of the key areas of assistance was with women from the South, many of whom were targeted by predatory employment agencies that would force them into debt and, at times, horrendous working conditions. Black (and sometimes white) social workers were sent out to assist with directions, funds, a place to stay, and advocacy.53 The largest organization working with Black migrants from the South in this period was the National Urban League (NUL).54 Black social worker and social work educator George Haynes founded and led the NUL, which Elmer Martin and Joanne Mitchell Martin say had the “leading, most advanced black social workers.”55 The NUL monitored existing relief programs, advocating for Black people who had been treated unjustly.56 They worked to ensure economic access to Black people, which involved combatting racism and difficult social and material conditions,

University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division. Edição do Kindle. conditions, and to reframe Southern Black migrants as skilled workers in the ruling class social imagination. The NUL advocated for Black migrants to become “skilled, unionized industrial workers [who would be fully integrated] into the urban political economy.”57 Yet, this goal was accomplished by working to assimilate the migrants to Northern and middle class mores and sensibilities. This approach, according to Martin and Martin, led to social workers focusing on changing individuals to adapt to existing social structures rather than working to change unjust social systems58 – as with most social services at the time. The demographic and social shift of the Great Migration also marked an important point in previously all-white “services” that were now available to, and imposed upon, Black people. Sharon Snyder and David Mitchell discuss the profound differences in the institutionalization of communities based on race. Once slavery was abolished, the US state began the mass incarceration of Black people; by the start of the Great Migration, Black people made up the majority of people incarcerated in prisons and asylums. Due to racist segregation, Black people hadn’t previously been institutionalized in poor houses and asylums during much of the nineteenth century, but this policy shifted post-emancipation, and Black people became increasingly pathologized. By 1919, for example, the political phenomena of diagnosing “feeblemindedness was so prevalent among African American children that all the black schools in one southern Georgia county had been closed.”59 Now, articulated through the new eugenics discourse, all Black children were said to be uneducable. Snyder and Mitchell describe how the white supremacist pathologization of the entire population of Black people as feebleminded “served to disqualify the population as viable candidates for eugenically based [individualistic] interventions.” They write that Black people therefore “largely escaped the devastation of eugenics-based practices,” and, as a result, it was only in “the late 1940s [that] African Americans with disabilities begin to be institutionalized along with their white counterparts.”60 While this pattern seems true of medically justified institutionalization, they also observe that the mass imprisonment of Black people had begun earlier. At this time, any gender-segregated confinement was commonly rationalized as a form of eugenics with the explicitly intended effect of keeping people from reproducing. These early justifications should be kept in mind when reflecting upon the political function of prisons and other closed institutions today. From the beginning of the Great Migration, Black communities organized to provide “outdoor relief,” which allowed people to access goods and resources while remaining free from confinement; at the same time, white communities were beginning to massively confine many Black people in the asylums and prisons that were a legacy of an earlier move towards the “indoor relief” of poor white people. As was the case with the earlier shift among denigrated Europeans and white settlers,* the massive use of confinement came about because it became increasingly socially unacceptable for white people to openly and publicly kill and torture Black people,61 due to the efforts of early Black social working and activism. This new use of confinement as a primary means of the racist social control of Black people also coincided closely with the mass confinement of Indigenous children in the Indian residential school system, which the government of the Province of Canada took on as a major policy initiative in the 1840s;62 it was now also becoming increasingly socially unacceptable for white people to openly and publicly kill and torture Indigenous people.63 So, while it is true that Black, Indigenous, and racialized people largely escaped the specific violences of early eugenic policies and practices,64 this “escape” carries a very different meaning if intersected with concurrent histories of anti-Black lynching, western expansion, and the Indian Wars. Once such overt racialized violence became increasingly less acceptable, imprisonment, institutionalization, and Indian residential schools were massively used against racialized and Indigenous populations.65 Continuities can therefore be traced between plantation slavery and today’s seemingly entirely distinct institutions of anti-Black racism. For example, Malcolm X recalled his childhood involvement with state welfare workers as so fundamentally characterized by white people shaming his mother that he considered it a legacy of rampant white shaming, denigration, and control of Black mothers during slavery; he also notes another continuity of slavery in the fact that he became the legal property of the white state once apprehended, with white social workers controlling where he lived and what he did.66 Anti-racist activists have also drawn connections between slavery and what was only then becoming today’s prison system. Although US slavery was abolished in 1865 through the Thirteenth Amendment, the same legislative act named the enslavement of convicts an exception: “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.”67 This law enabled two already existing systems of violence and control to intersect and maintain the exploitation of Black labour. Laws in the North and South that targeted free Black people already existed, enabling Black people to be arrested and punished for things that no white person was criminalized for doing. Following slavery abolition, this persecution intensified with the Black Codes of 1865 and 1866.68 These codes intersected with another violent system that previously mostly targeted white convicts and hadn’t yet been an instrument of anti-Black racism. The convict lease system allowed convicts to be “leased” to companies and forced to engage in unpaid labour (the state was paid a small sum for their labour but prisoners received nothing). Post-emancipation, in tandem with the Black Codes and the continued legality of enslaving convicts according to the Thirteenth Amendment, the convict lease system enabled the enslavement of many Black people. In 1892, Ida B. Wells documented conditions within this racist system: “In one camp it is stated that the mortality is 10 per cent per month, and in another even more than that. In these camps men and women are found chained together.” She also reported: “Men who failed to perform their task of mining from two to four tons of coal per day were fastened to planks by the feet, then bent over a barrel and fastened by the hands on the other side, stripped and beaten with a strap.”69 Although fewer people were subjected to this system than had been subjected to slavery, the experiences of those subjected to convict leasing weren’t particularly different from slavery. A similar pattern of reform functioning simply to reorganize power followed the civil rights gains and abolition of legal racial segregation a century later. One racist system was abolished, and other long-existing systems of control and violence (previously used mostly against marginalized white people) now became mobilized in anti-Black racism: “child protective systems” didn’t normatively target Black families until the end of racial segregation,70 psychiatry began to target folks active in Black Power movements, so that “schizophrenia became a Black disease;”71 and the US prison system has expanded monumentally since the gains of Black Power movements. There’s a clear relationship between the inheritances of slavery and the ongoing white supremacist structural violence of the prison system. Due to the specific context of the historical emergence of the prison and the shared characteristics of certain power relations in slavery and imprisonment, Angela Davis invites her readers to consider: “Is racism so deeply entrenched in the institution of the prison that it is not possible to eliminate one without eliminating the other?”72 In addition to continuities dating back to slavery in today’s anti-Black racism, new racist stories emerged in the wake of slavery abolition that serve to pre-empt and delegitimize critique of the white supremacist prison system. Post-emancipation, Black people were subjected to the tremendously harsh and arbitrary Black Codes and thus were incarcerated as a result of structural anti-Black racism rather than due to committing a disproportionate number of crimes. However, critique was pre-empted within white consciousness when “during the 1870s the growing number of black prisoners in the South further buttressed the belief that African Americans were inherently criminal.”73 This belief dovetailed with concurrent developments in eugenic criminology that claimed to scientifically prove that some people were “born criminals.”74 While eugenic criminology tended to target marginalized white people (due perhaps to the continuous violence of anti-Black lynching and the eugenic belief that every single Black person is unfit75), the notion of an inherent criminality intersected with new discourses of anti-Black racism at the time of slavery abolition. As a result, we’ve inherited and continue to perpetuate the enduring, false, and clearly racist notion that Black people are more prone to crime than white people. Black Settlement Houses Settlement houses were also founded in Black communities during the Progressive Era. The standard account of the development of social work depicts settlement houses as following a model imported from the United Kingdom, but Ralph Luker argues that these institutions were strongly influenced by missions established by Northern Black churches in the South starting in 1869, six years after slavery was abolished in the United States. These missions shared similar ideas and practices, and sometimes staff. Luker calls these Black missions “proto-settlement houses.” Many were developed by Black religious organizations, others by white religious or philanthropic organizations.76 These “proto-settlement houses” were created to address the difficulties many Black people in the South faced post-emancipation, and they preceded the first settlement house in the world (Toynbee Hall, in London, England) by fifteen years. In 1890, the year after Jane Addams and Ellen Gates Starr founded Hull-House, Janie Barrett founded the Locust Street Settlement in Virginia, which is officially the first “settlement house” for Black people.77 The timeline, however, may prove a little more complicated. The Locust Street Settlement grew out of a service Barrett had been providing in her own home for several years previous to this point.78 But Hull-House didn’t emerge the previous year with the breadth of services it would later come to offer; it started much more humbly, initially only providing childcare for working women.79 What this complication means is that Barrett had initiated some of the work, later called the settlement work of the Locust Street Settlement, several years before Addams had even devised the idea of opening a “settlement house” of her own. Does that timeline mean Barrett should get credit for the first US settlement house? Maybe, maybe not.* But it certainly makes a difference to how this history tends to be framed. As discussed in the previous chapter, origin stories matter. They make a difference to how social work is conceived, how race is conceived, and how the two are imagined to intersect with one another. If Hull-House was only the first American “settlement house” in name, or even only “the first white settlement house,” as opposed to being the first settlement house in terms of what it did, then surely this alternative timeline complicates the account that tends to be told about the birth of social work. If concrete and acknowledged antecedents to settlement work are found in earlier Black social interventions, this finding complicates accounts we tend to tell about a number of things, from social work to the role of Black people in shaping the world more generally. At least eleven Black communities had settlement houses by 1910, and several had more than one (Philadelphia had at least three). Black missions or settlements (the name is significant: “missions” underscores that these predated Hull-House and even Toynbee Hall; “settlements” mobilizes the moral economies of white supremacy and secularism to bestow a certain legitimacy to this Black “social work”) provided a plethora of services and programs, including schools for students and future teachers, healthcare services, agricultural conferences, mothers’ meetings, short-term housing, daycare, and the distribution of coal and food. Some also conducted social science studies of the Black communities they served.80 Woman’s Christian Temperance Union Another important part of social work history that often gets left out of the standard account is temperance organizing. In the mid- to late nineteenth century, the temperance movement was large and very influential. The largest temperance organization was the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), founded in 1874. The WCTU had a massive woman-run publishing operation – producing 125,000 pages in 1890. In Canada, the first WCTU chapter was founded in Ontario in 1877; the Dominion WCTU, Canada’s national organization, was founded in 1888. The Canadian WCTUs were modelled after and mentored by the American WCTU and had their strongest support in rural areas.

Chapman, Chris; Withers, A.J.. A Violent History of Benevolence: Interlocking Oppression in the Moral Economies of Social Working (pp. 086-091). University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division. Edição do Kindle. After only three years, the Dominion WCTU had nearly 10,000 members, and in 1914 it had nearly 17,000. The WCTU in the United States was made up of autonomous local organizations, some of which were mixed race while others were racially segregated. In the South, it was commonplace to have segregated unions; generally, Black unions were called “number two.”81 Therefore, both of the following are true: white supremacy ensured that Black women were considered second class in the national unions and broader social structures;82 and Black women were active in WCTUs and made important contributions to the organization and the temperance movement more broadly.83 It is important to acknowledge the exaltation of white women in the leadership of the organization, as well as to recognize that Black women played significant roles in it. The most prominent Black woman in the WCTU was Francis Harper. She became the superintendent of Work Among the Colored People of the North in 1883, a position she held for several years. Alison Parker explains that Harper and other Black women were attracted to the WCTU because of “its commitment to national legislation and federal solutions to moral and social problems in the United States.”84 Harper strove towards interracial cooperation and travelled the country advocating for it within the WCTU and Black temperance activism more generally. Harper supported women’s suffrage and viewed white women as important potential allies. She advocated for and had some (limited) success in having more Black representation in the national governing bodies of the WCTU.85 The WCTU and other temperance organizations did a great deal of the kinds of work that those who are credited as founding social work were also doing. Like Hull-House, the WCTU was headquartered in Chicago and did social work such as operating homes for “fallen women,” establishing kindergartens, providing vocational training, advocating for better care for orphaned children, engaging in prison and policing reform projects (which included calls for police matrons and forced prison labour), providing educational programs for mothers and children, and advocating for legislation reform to protect girls.86 The WCTU also worked to lay the groundwork for women to become more prominent in political reform. Significantly, Francis Willard, the long-time leader of the WCTU, called the work of the WCTU “social work.”* Why then would the WCTU be left out of the standard account of social work history? Carol Mattingly posits that the WCTU is largely excluded from feminist history because of “contemporary scholars’ discomfort with temperance women’s religious/evangelical associations.”87 This theory seems likely in relation to social work history, whether feminist or otherwise, due to the normative notion that progress over the last few centuries has mapped onto increasing secularism. From a contemporary standpoint, temperance organizing is a political anomaly: these women often used direct action protest tactics and were religious zealots. They viewed all social issues as caused by a single thing – alcohol (and sometimes other drugs like tobacco) – and they believed that eliminating this vice would solve social problems such as poverty and violence against women. Indeed, Frances Willard quoted Richard Cobden: “Temperance Reform lies at the foundation of all reforms.”88 Perhaps seemingly paradoxical by contemporary standards, Sharon Cook argues that the WCTU’s “conservative ideas of family relationships could, and did, result in progressive demands.”89 As a prime example, the WCTU led what may have been the earliest mass campaign against men’s violence against women and children – still a central social work issue today. The WCTU rallied around the watchword “home protection,” coined by Canadian WCTU leader Letitia Youmans. Willard made this watchword a guiding principle for the organization.90 Towards the end of the nineteenth century, alcohol consumption had been constructed as masculine with, according to Cook, “its most destructive impact on the home and the often defenceless family.”91 Alcohol was blamed for men’s desertion of their wives and children, poverty, domestic violence, and sexual assault. The WCTU saw eliminating alcohol as removing the root cause of all these problems. The WCTU circulated petitions against the assault on women and girls, and the organization’s members attended criminal trials in support of female victims of sexual violence. They led campaigns to raise the age of consent in the United States and Canada, and were almost always successful.92 Cook therefore writes that temperance was “a ‘constellation’ issue,” which included “several associated – and ultimately more important – concerns, through which women expressed their outrage at male violence and irresponsibility, their fears for the survival of the family unit, and, eventually, their collective demands for legislative solutions to these problems.”93 While blaming alcohol and other intoxicants for men’s violence against women, the WCTU nevertheless also politicized violence against women as a gendered social issue and was seemingly the first large cohesive group that organized to eliminate it. As with many social workers then and now, child protection and well-being were a major WCTU concern. In addition to homes for single mothers and their children, the WCTU worked with children’s aid societies to identify and assist children in need. When a child protection agency was created in Ontario, the WCTU expressed the desire to “greatly assist by recommending the names of suitable persons to help in this work.”94 In the United States, the Department of Securing Homes for Homeless Children attempted to do just that. Willard wrote: “Cooperation with existing Children’s Aid Societies is recommended … and [they] are glad to welcome us as coadjutors. It is not too much to say that the salvation of our beloved country depends upon the salvation of these children.”95 The WCTU and its youth counterpart, the YWCTU, ran a number of homes for women in the United States. In Canada, Ottawa’s Home for Friendless Women provided shelter for “fallen women” with children, teaching them parenting skills and providing them with basic necessities. In order to stay in the home, women had to agree to live there for one year or more. The program was designed to both punish and rehabilitate these women, in part through long hours of laundry work. The shelter also took in old women. Another shelter was the “Frances E. Willard Home for Girls [which] was a temporary shelter for young women in Toronto founded around 1895.”96 Its 1905 annual report stated: “Girls coming to the city with no definite idea as to employment are counselled to go to private houses as domestics, and situations are usually found for them.”97 In 1903, the Ontario WCTU noted: “Owing to the ever-increasing demand for domestics the average time of the girls in Home is too short to admit of much training, nevertheless we are persuaded that through the sheltering care of the Home and its matron many a soul has been saved from degradation.”98 The Ontario WCTU’s annual reports from 1890 to 1926 also suggest an ongoing interest in working specifically in Black and Indigenous communities.99 While they seem to have imagined that work in Indigenous communities first required contact with white missionaries,* it appears that the position of superintendent for “Work among the Colored People” was inconsistently held by Black and white women.* These reports also suggest a different spin on “temperance,” which makes sense given the era, but is often left out of what could perhaps be called the standard account of the WCTU. It would seem that their concern about alcohol was, at least in part, a eugenic one. As mentioned earlier, eugenicists believed that social and behavioural influences could shape biology as much as they believed that degeneracy works in the opposite direction. Drinking could thus both cause bad heredity and be caused by bad heredity. Therefore, drinking was believed to lead to many other forms of moral and physical degeneracy. Mrs E. Adelia Lucas served as superintendent of the Ontario WCTU’s Department of Heredity and Hygiene. In 1890, she wrote: “The sin of bringing into the world diseased and defective children is almost unpardonable, and the sin of marrying and inebriating and having descendants tainted and switched off on to the side-track of ruin is literally a crime that can never be atoned for.”100 The WCTU founded the Department of Heredity and Hygiene to investigate the eugenic causes of alcohol and tobacco consumption, which “was soon broadened, so as to include all hereditary tendencies, healthful and pure, as well as diseased conditions.” Lucas maintained that these tendencies reflect “one of God’s primal laws for all living things.”101 Her eugenic rhetoric, then, is thoroughly Christian – undermining the often-assumed analysis that what was considered science displaced religion at this “progressive” time. The WCTU’s Department of Heredity and Hygiene wove science into its religious world view. Anti-Lynching Lynching, the act of extralegal mob murder, became increasingly commonplace as a racialized form of violence in many parts of the United States following emancipation. Although lynching was not a new practice, for the first time in 1885 there were more lynchings of Black people than white, and this tendency persisted until around the time that Black people began to be institutionalized.102 The year-by-year statistics show a dramatic increase of lynching in general, alongside a decrease in white people who were lynched each year. When Black people were no longer considered the property of individual white people who could punish and kill them at will, mobs of white people began to increasingly murder Black people. This violence was often rationalized by claiming that they were protecting themselves or other whites (particularly the virtue of white women) from crimes committed by Black people. According to Davis, after the Civil War, “white supremacy continued to be embraced by vast numbers of people and became deeply inscribed in new institutions. One of these post-slavery institutions was lynching, which was widely accepted for many decades thereafter.”103 Lynching was brutal and torturous; it was also commonplace. A draft of a petition to the federal and state governments in 1918 describes what was going on at the time: The reported causes for such appalling brutality run the gamut from alleged violation of the honor of white women to disputing the word of white men … [However,] only about five per cent of these murders are reputed to have been inflicted upon accused violators of womanhood … [so] the desire to protect womanhood is almost negligibly among the so-called causes of lynchings … May your silence be construed as tacit approval or active tolerance of these things?104 Ida B. Wells-Barnett estimated that 10,000 Black people were lynched in the three decades following the Civil War (1865–1895).105 These murders were horrors on multiple levels: they targeted individuals for torture and death, affected families who were left grieving their loved ones and finding themselves in deeper poverty with the loss of their husband or father’s income, and also affected entire communities, in that many Black people knew people who had been lynched or disappeared. That one could be attacked for standing up for oneself, defending oneself, or simply for being Black would have led to persistent fear in the Black community, as it was designed to do. Trigger warning: Please be advised that the following four paragraphs include graphic descriptions of lynchings. Lynchings were often conducted during the day and in public in order to maximize their impact on terrorizing Black populations and constraining them to rigidly racialized social mores. The 1918 anti-lynching petition mentioned earlier, for example, describes one lynching in which a Black man was burned at the stake and “an entire helpless colored population was marched around the fire, amid fumes of a burning human being and put on notice that as that black man was suffering they too should fear to suffer.”106 Lynching was explicitly about keeping Black people in fear as a tactic to keep them subordinated. It secured the force of the colour line post-emancipation, socializing both white and Black people to occupy their respective stratified moral and political positions. At the height of anti-Black lynching, white people took photos of mutilated Black bodies and had them mass printed as postcards,107 which were sold at stores and sent through the US postal service.* The rise of anti-Black lynching maps neatly onto the birth and flourishing of eugenics. If not taken as mere coincidence, this intersection suggests a shift in ruling class white morality in Europe and white settler colonies where racialized, poor, disabled, and otherwise oppressed communities were being targeted for eradication in new ways. As poor and disabled white people were increasingly targeted for incarceration and reproductive,

University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division. Edição do Kindle. economic, and social death, Black people were initially not incarcerated; instead they were being killed. Of the uneven relationship at the time between anti-Black lynching and disablist eugenics, one illustrative event was the murder of a “seventeen year old boy by the name of Jesse Washington … in 1916,” which is the year after the cornerstone eugenic criminology text, The Criminal Imbecile, was published.108 James Allen says that Jesse Washington was “seriously mentally challenged. The wife of the farmer he worked for was found dead.”109 Jesse was tried and convicted. From Rafter’s history of eugenic criminology, we might expect that Jesse would have been given an indefinite prison sentence, resulting in a eugenically rationalized lifelong incarceration due to his intellectual disability – although in Texas, where he was killed, he may have been more likely confined to an asylum for his life. Regardless, neither of these things took place. Instead he was dragged out of the courtroom, kicked down the steps, tortured, burned alive, castrated, had his fingers cut off one by one, and hanged. “There were 16,000 people crowding the street to watch this boy be tortured … [T]here were cheers, like at a football game, cheering the torturers on.” Perhaps Jesse was partly targeted because he was disabled, but he was publicly tortured and murdered because he was Black.110 Ida B. Wells-Barnett Black communities fought vigorously to abolish lynching. One of the most prominent anti-lynching activists was Ida B. Wells (Wells-Barnett,† following her marriage).111 She was also a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the National Association of Colored Women, and was active in the women’s club movement. In 1884, she first gained wide recognition for refusing to move from an all-white train car and for winning a settlement against the railroad.112 Wells wrote a condemnation of lynching in Memphis’s Free Speech and Headlight after her friend Tom Moss was lynched for defending himself from white men’s physical attacks in 1892. Due to the response to this condemnation, she was forced to flee the South. She recalls: “It was for the assertion of this fact, in the defense of her own race, that the writer hereof became an exile; her property destroyed and her return to her home forbidden under penalty of death.”113 Nevertheless, she continued to agitate against lynching. In 1899, she wrote and circulated a pamphlet, “Lynch Law in Georgia,” to Black communities in Chicago. She wrote: “The real purpose of the savage demonstrations is to teach the Negro that in the south he has no rights that the law will enforce. Samuel House was burned to teach the Negroes that no matter what a white man does to them, they must not resist.”114 In response to dominant framings of anti-Black lynching more generally, and specifically to Jane Addams’s acceptance of this normative white framing in her own condemnation of lynching, Wells demonstrated that most lynchings didn’t involve even a claim* that the murdered man had raped a white woman.115 She showed that many of the lynchings committed on the grounds of sexual assault by Black men against white women were actually white responses to consensual interracial relationships, which were considered unacceptable within interlocking white supremacist patriarchal moral economies.116 White men had only recently lost unmitigated sexual access to the Black women they owned in law, regardless of these women’s desires and consent, with the end of slavery.117 The predominant white account of lynching at the time was that white women were regularly raped by Black men, but Andrea Smith challenges the fictitiousness of this narrative: “In fact, Black women needed protection from white men.”118 Indeed, Wells-Barnett’s grandmother was a slave and her father a slave-owner’s son – so he was likely a child who resulted from rape, as was common during slavery.119 Although fictitious, the prevalent notion that white men had to lynch Black men in order to save white women from Black rape was so pervasive that Hollywood’s first blockbuster, The Birth of a Nation, which had the highest grossing ticket sales until Gone with the Wind twenty-four years later,120 depicts what claims to be a historical account of post-Civil War reconstruction and glorifies the founding of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) and a lynching in response to a Black man raping a white woman.121 When considering the views of Smith and Wells-Barnett on lynching Black men accused of raping white women, it’s important to note that white men who raped any woman of any race were never lynched. In fact, most often there was no consequence at all. Contemporary readers should remember this point if they find Wells-Barnett’s handling of rape and sexual assault accusations troubling due to having been socialized within second wave feminism’s crucial politicization of sexual assault and the importance of believing those who say they’ve been sexually assaulted. That indispensable lesson needs to be taken into account, alongside a concern about white supremacist framings of Black and racialized men as particularly prone to rape and other patriarchal violence. Of course, even consensual relationships can involve sexual assault – a point which could be said to become lost within Wells-Barnett’s claim that the issue pertains to race and not sexual assault as the (interracial) relationship was consensual. (That, said, it was not until the 1970s in the United States122 and in 1983 in Canada123 that men could be held legally responsible for raping their wives.) However, it doesn’t appear Wells-Barnett believed that rape never happened. But she was fighting against the ruse by which rape (real or fictitious) was used to excuse lynching. Like many other Black feminists, Wells-Barnett understood how gender and race interlocked, and she fought against this interlocking oppression rather than against racism or sexism in isolation. Carlton-LaNey writes of such anti-lynching work, saying that Black women at the time “recognize[d] the political nature of sexism long before their white counterparts.” Wells-Barnett and other early Black social workers “faced the fact that sexual exploitation and violence were perpetuated by both African American and white men.” Carlton-LaNey therefore argues that “politicizing sexual exploitation and harassment for African American women placed it squarely within the context of race. Combatting sexual exploitation, therefore, was inextricably linked to race uplift.”124 Early anti-racist feminism did not minimize sexism or sexual assault; rather, it politicized sexism, sexual assault, and responses to them in multiple directions. Andrea Smith begins her chapter “Sexual Violence as a Tool of Genocide” by troubling Susan Brownmiller’s second wave white feminist assertion that rape “is nothing more or less than a conscious process of intimidation by which all men keep all women in a state of fear.” Smith uses this statement as a springboard to explore how racism and colonialism shape the particulars of what rape is.125 Likewise, Wells-Barnett was centrally concerned with situating rape and rape discourse within what contemporary feminists call interlocking oppression, as evidenced by her repeated discussions of gender and race and, to a lesser extent, class.126 Such early anti-racist feminist understandings of interlocking oppression trouble the common history of feminism in which interlocking analyses are a recent development initiated by Black feminists such as the Combahee River Collective,127 Kimberlé Crenshaw,128 Patricia Hill Collins,129 Angela Davis,130 Audre Lorde,131 and bell hooks.132 Without minimizing the importance of Black feminism since the 1970s (which often honours earlier Black feminist history), the Black feminist struggle to work against interlocking oppression goes back to the first wave of feminism, which is largely left out of white histories of feminism. It’s not that we wish to reduce the importance of recent anti-racist feminist authors and activists; it’s that remembering the earlier anti-racist feminists raises troubling questions about how feminism’s history up to the 1970s came to be recorded as yet another white history. After fleeing the South, Wells-Barnett organized anti-lynching organizations in a number of states.133 These and other anti-lynching campaigns were hugely influential in Black communities in the United States. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) emerged from anti-lynching activists. Founded in 1909 by a mixture of some of the Black community organizers we’re discussing in this chapter – Wells-Barnett, Terrell, and Du Bois – and some white activists (including Addams), the NAACP has worked for racial equality for over a century and is still active today.134 White Social Work and Anti-Lynching Addams and Wells-Barnett were contemporaries and allies in numerous political struggles.135 Although Addams was somewhat exceptional (for a white person) for her commitment to anti-racism, including her activism against lynching, she also accepted that aspects of the white supremacist connection between sexual assault and lynching were true. She was a member of the NAACP at the time, yet she felt entitled to do and say things that appear to have been unaccountable to the experiences of Black communities. According to Wilma Peebles-Wilkins and E. Aracelis Francis, Addams “did not seem to understand that lynchings involved innocent victims and were not just an unacceptable response to crime.”136 Addams accepted the view that Black men posed a threat to white women and white communities, but objected to lynchings on the grounds that they were not an effective deterrent to this kind of violence and punishment for crimes should be left to the legal system. She also wrote that lynchings were effective in reducing crimes committed by Black men because “certain elements of the self can be prevented from coming into action,” but pointed out that this inhibition was only a temporary fix because these “elements of the self” might resurface.137 Addams’s analysis was shaped by her whiteness and her class positioning, by moral economies of white supremacy, and by discourses stressing the importance of the rule of law and Black men’s criminality. Like Addams, Willard of the WCTU also didn’t understand that lynching was used to control and terrorize Black people. The WCTU refused to allow Wells to address its annual national assembly in 1893. The following year, Wells secured the sponsorship of an organization to ensure that she could address the meeting. She wanted to confront the WCTU’s failure to publicly condemn the lynching of Black men.138 Wells’s insistence on confronting Willard and the WCTU was provoked by an 1890 interview in which Willard made several racist comments about Black people. Willard’s remarks included reiterating the notion that Black men pose a threat to the safety of women and children. She said of white Southerners: “The problem in their hands is immeasurable. The colored race multiplies like the locusts of Egypt. The grog-shop [liquor store] is a center of power. The safety of women, of childhood, of the home is menaced.”139 Willard thus reiterated the frequent justification of lynching due to the supposed threat that Black men posed to white women. It is particularly concerning that one of the earliest organizations combatting violence against women reified the idea that Black men were exceptionally violent towards women and failed to condemn the racist violence of lynching. When Wells identified Willard’s position as untrue and racist, Willard defended her position. However, she added: I wish I had said then, as I do now, that the immoralities of white men in their relations with colored women are the source of intolerable race prejudice and hatred, and that there is not a more withering curse upon the manhood of any nation than that which the eternal laws of nature visited upon those men in those homes in which the helpless bondwoman was made the victim of her master’s base desire.140 While Willard continued to claim that Black men posed a sexual threat to white women and girls, she attempted to soften her claims with the acknowledgment that white men also posed a threat to Black women and girls. But, as Mattingly observes, Willard’s condemnation of white men was “situated primarily in the past and associated with the evils of slavery.”141 In effect, Willard was saying that white men may have once posed a threat to Black women and girls, but now it is only Black men who are still dangerous. In response to building pressure, including the condemnation of the WCTU by other prominent Black social justice organizers, the WCTU passed a resolution against lynching in 1895. The resolution stated defensively that the WCTU “ought never to have been placed in the position of having to defend themselves from the charge that they favored the lynching of any human being, anywhere, under any circumstances.”142 It also claimed that people “misrepresented our position,” likely referring to Wells, Ransom, and others who demanded that the WCTU actively and publicly condemn lynching. Coming across this story from about 120 years ago, we recognize the still all-too-familiar pattern within social justice work

University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division. Edição do Kindle. and beyond. Rather than deeply reflecting on her position, this white person in a leadership position, and the organization under her direction, dug in their heels and refused to acknowledge the harm they’d caused. The white people thus claimed their own innocence143 and, worse still, depicted themselves as wronged for having been accused of racism. The implication is that the Black community organizers who challenged the organization’s position were overreacting, too sensitive, and too angry – all of which reaffirms white supremacist anti-Black stereotypes. For this reason, these stories of Wells, Willard, and Addams are not only important as history but also as examples of how people today who claim to be allies need to be reflexive and of when they should defer to the lead of those most directly affected by an issue. Our aim here, with respect to Addams and Willard, is to paint a more complex picture of them – particularly of Addams. We’re all formed by discourses, practices, and moral economies of interlocking oppression. They shape what we can know, believe, and perceive. It’s not that this shaping is out of the realm of our influence or that either woman is innocent. Recognizing these complexities and holding their positive anti-oppressive practice in tension with the clearly racist, classist, and otherwise oppressive things they did is useful in helping us all understand that we’re complicit in oppression even when working against it. Acknowledging this complicity is a crucial part of critical or anti-oppressive practice.144 Early Black social workers were not perfect either. Like everyone else, they were flawed people with imperfect politics who sometimes did oppressive things and often held problematic views about other people. They were part of the project of social work’s new and politically complicated interventions into the social world, and sometimes this project brought an increase in surveillance, assimilation, classism, cisheterosexism, and social control into Black communities. We don’t want to paint a picture of any of these figures as perfect, because we can only follow in the footsteps of the types of people that we know to have existed. As Davis asks of representations of Martin Luther King, Jr: “How could you possibly measure up to someone like that?”145 She stresses that the Montgomery bus boycott – widely considered the birth of the civil rights movement – was started by ordinary people just like any one of us, and she emphasizes how important it is for us to know this in order to open possibilities for considering what role we might play in fundamental social transformation. Maggie L. Walker and the Independent Order of St Luke Maggie L. Walker’s record of significantly intervening into the social world begins with her participation in what is believed to be the first anti-segregation school strike by Black students in the United States in 1883. She went on to become a teacher and part-time worker at an insurance company and later was hired as the secretary for the Independent Order of St Luke in Richmond, Virginia. The order had been founded in 1867 by former slave Mary Prout in Baltimore.146 Lily Hardy Hammond, writing in 1922, describes the Order of St Luke when Walker first came on board as “a little benefit society in Richmond – one of probably a dozen or two,” which had around 1,000 members. These societies were commonplace in Black communities where “sickness [was] a catastrophe such as only the poorest people can fully comprehend.” The society paid its members out of dues if a member became sick or died, “thus saving the family from what is often, among the very poor, a crushing burden of debt.”147 At a time when nation-states were just beginning to offer workers’ compensation themselves, local collective organizations, included this one started by Prout, acted as a social safety net. Working class people, including Black people and recent immigrants, would cumulatively contribute to a fund, and the collective would then support them from that fund if they needed it.148 The gradual development of private disability, workers’ compensation, and life insurance are commonly described as contributing to the development of the modern welfare state and as a key part of social work history.149 Walker worked to expand services; by 1922, there were 100,000 members with the organization across twenty-one states. Walker also started the St Luke’s Herald, which provided community and organizational news, and covered topics that preoccupied social work publications of the day such as “health, thrift, morals, and education.”150 The Herald also provided detailed accounts of lynchings, segregation, and racism. The order adopted political positions, including supporting universal suffrage and anti-lynching efforts. It led the Richmond streetcar boycott against segregation in 1904.151 The Independent Order of St Luke created a bank in 1903 under Walker’s direction. Walker thus became the first woman president of a bank in the United States. The bank provided financing for Black people to buy homes and go to college, among other things.152 These funds would have been otherwise difficult or impossible for Black people in the South to obtain. The predominantly circulated history of the credit union is that it was spread by Desjardins to the United States in 1908.153 Credit unions began in Germany, and had begun to be established in Québec by Alphonse Desjardins in 1900 to help low-income people secure credit. Walker’s bank seems to have been aligned with the ethos of early collectivist credit unions. When such work is undertaken by a disadvantaged racialized group to provide services for those who couldn’t otherwise access them due to racial segregation and rampant poverty, it is a significant intervention into the social world, enabling people to better navigate and mitigate capitalism’s violences. In 1909, Walker wrote that she wished to “turn the course of that almighty stream of dollar, and see if we can till our own barren lands, feed our own hungry, and clothe our own naked.”154 Yet, this bank is not considered part of credit union history. Like many other early women social workers of her time, Walker was also involved in club work. She founded a Richmond Council of Colored Women, which did community service and fundraising.155 When given the opportunity, Walker and other community members fundraised to establish a home for young women, with help from a white philanthropist. According to Walker, “The white philanthropist … said that if we colored women would show our interest in social work among our people by raising a thousand dollars for it, he would give us the use of a large house, and if we made good, he would deed it to a board of white and colored women for colored work.”156 In response to this possibility, the community raised the money, and the women established the home. Walker said that white women in Richmond “had done fine community work for white people,” but that, with respect to this project, “the white women don’t work for us, – they work with us.”157 Walker worked with whomever was necessary, doing whatever was necessary, to help the Black community of Richmond and, indeed, the whole country. However, if you check the index of any social work text that is not specifically about Black social work, it is almost guaranteed that you won’t find her name there. The Social Work Profession, Social Science, and Education Through the Progressive Era, many professions were not accessible to Black people in Canada and the United States because of the racist, segregationist educational and economic systems. Francille Wilson writes that the only two professions open to Black people were “teaching and preaching,”158 neither of which required a degree at the time. Social work had the potential to be yet another accessible profession for Black people,159 given that it was outside the systems of governing accredited bodies and academic programs (unlike law and medicine, by this time). Decent paid jobs were frequently obtainable for Black social workers in a number of social sectors, although often in segregated agencies or departments.160 The availability of social work jobs may, in part, explain why an increasing number of Black (and white) men entered the profession, which had previously been considered women’s work.161 In fact, differentiating social work from charity often mapped onto differentiating the work that men were doing from that which women had been doing previously.162 An increasing emphasis on the use of social science was present in Black social work at the time. In the late nineteenth century, W.E.B. Du Bois started doing sociological studies of Black communities that served to identify their needs and combat racist notions about them.163 Some social science emphasized the desire to take social work out of the hands of the churches,164 but social science was taken up by social gospellers as well.165 As in white social work, a belief in the importance of systematic and scientific social work was commonly held by Black social workers across the political spectrum during this period.166 Black social workers also developed social work educational programs, with the first undergraduate program beginning in 1911.167 George Haynes, co-founder of the National Urban League (discussed earlier), established the program at Fisk University and advocated that an understanding of Black history was necessary for Black people to conduct effective Black social work.168 Haynes was motivated by the desire to ensure that Black service users were served by Black workers and that Black social workers did not become a professional underclass because they had fewer academic credentials.169 The first social work graduate program at a Black educational institution was established in 1922 at Atlanta’s Morehouse College,170 and several other programs were created around the same time.171 Although social work programs had previously been available in white institutions, they did not teach from a Black perspective or address needs that were considered important in Black communities. Black Social Work in Canada Black social work in Canada has a number of similarities to the US history: churches played a major role in community work, reform efforts, and charity; there was a strong tradition of neighbour-to-neighbour helping and community improvement; and women took on important organizing roles, particularly with respect to schools and anti-slavery organizing.172 However, because Black communities were so much smaller in Canada than in the United States, and because of other factors such as political economy, geography, and climate, there were important differences too. The level of formal organization that occurred in the United States was simply not present in Canadian Black communities during the Progressive Era.173 Nonetheless, Black social work and social workers made important contributions to their communities and to the emerging profession of social work. Canada had a significant Black population for a number of reasons, including its own legacy of slavery, which began in 1628 when the first African slave was brought to what is now called Canada.174 The main sources of Black immigrants to Canada were slaves who accompanied British loyalists during the American Revolution, escaped slaves from Jamaica (known as the Maroons), freemen after the War of 1812, escaped American slaves through the Underground Railroad, and free US Black people trying to avoid American racism.175 Black communities in Canada during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were largely found in Ontario (called Upper Canada, Canada West, and the Province of Canada at various times) and Nova Scotia,176 although there were also notable populations on Vancouver Island177 and in Montréal178 and several smaller cities.179 This settlement pattern was largely a product of the proximity of these English-speaking areas to the United States. Some Black settlers also migrated to the western provinces, but the government instituted anti-Black immigration policies before their numbers could rise significantly, as we discuss in chapter 4.180 Many US regions where Black people were legally “free” had Black Laws or Black Codes, which seriously restricted the freedom and ability of many Black people to settle. This legal framework was yet another reason some Black people immigrated to Canada.181 In 1850, the US government passed the Fugitive Slave Act, allowing for the arrest of any escaped slave anywhere in the United States and requiring that person’s return to their former “owner.”182 In the years following the passage of this act, around 50,000 former slaves* immigrated to Upper Canada.183 (To provide some perspective, the population of Toronto, called York at the time, was only 100,000 in 1841.184) Settlements in Canada A number of settlements were intentionally established as communities for escaped slaves and other Black people seeking a better life outside the pervasive and institutional racism of the United States. While this organizing has not been traditionally depicted as social work, those responsible for these initiatives were clearly engaged in making individuals’ lives better,

University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division. Edição do Kindle. strengthening their communities, and undertaking many efforts that would later be called social work when white people did the same things for recent immigrants from Europe. It should be noted, though, that in spite of Canada’s depiction as a refuge for Black people, many were surprised to find extreme racism in Canada as well.185 This hostility, as well as the difficulty of living off the land, meant that most people in the settlements had very difficult lives. A group of Black people who lived in Cincinnati organized to leave the city and travel to Canada in 1829. Cincinnati was a trading hub with the South, and white power brokers ensured that it was inhospitable to Black people.186 The city enforced the state’s Black Laws, requiring, among other things, that new Black residents pay a $500 bond to ensure that they would be of good behaviour.187 In 1829, massive anti-Black race riots took place in Cincinnati. In an attempt to quell the violence and protect their families and property, about 300 Black men agreed to a government plan to voluntarily go to jail.188 This removal of adult men from the community did not quell the white attacks. However, according to Woodson, when the rioting ended, a number of the men who had surrendered themselves “were discharged on certificates of nativity, others gave bond for their support and good behavior, a few were dismissed as non-residents, a number of them were discharged by a justice of the Court of Common Pleas, and the rest were held indefinitely.”189 Black men who had voluntarily agreed to be incarcerated in the hopes of staving off white violence were forced into forms of bail bonds, driven from the city, or indefinitely imprisoned. Prior to this incident, a group of local organizers had been planning to create a community in Ontario. The organizers likely chose an isolated rural area because they wanted to protect their community from white racism and aspired to achieve economic self-sufficiency.190 The numbers swelled after the riot; somewhere between 460 and 2,000 people fled to Canada. They settled in a community they called Wilberforce, near London, Ontario.191 Over the next decade, a school, stores, and farms were established. Wilberforce is depicted as a failure in the historical literature, but Nikki Taylor notes that the settlement met its original goal of independence.192 One of the reasons it was ultimately unsustainable was that the Canada Land Company, the Crown corporation that sold land to settlers, stopped selling land to Black settlers due to protests from white settlers in the region and the common white supremacist belief that Black people were not reliable enough to uphold their contracts.* In comparison to other settlements, Wilberforce was thus quite short lived. Yet, it provided an escape for many people fleeing racist violence and the Black Codes. Another settlement established near Windsor by the Refugee Home Society was founded in 1851,193 the year after the Fugitive Slave Act was passed and a mass exodus from the United States to Canada began in response. The Refugee Home Society offered a land-granting program with a systematic approach for providing assistance. Fugitive slaves were granted land (twenty-five acres, five acres of which were free). Settlers were then given nine years to pay for the remaining land, and the profits from the venture went into operating a school and continuing the organization’s work, such as buying more land.194 One of the men credited with founding the Refugee Home Society is Henry Bibb. According to Fred Landon, Bibb believed that “the future of the people of color in Canada depended upon getting them settled on the land and his mind turned to the possibilities of establishing a distinctly Negro colony.”195 For Bibb and the many Black people who lived in, organized, and supported Black colonies, this venture was a liberatory project. For the people who found refuge in Canada, it was also a liberatory project. Yet, while this designation is straightforwardly true, these Black people were also setting up colonies within a white settler colony. Celebrating Bibb in 1920, Landon titled his article “Henry Bibb, a Colonizer.” Bibb saw his chance for freedom for himself and his community as an active part of the colonial process. What was justice for his community helped sustain an injustice for another. Noticing how this one intensely oppressed group was complicit in the oppression of Indigenous people is, by no means, an attempt to undermine the horrors of slavery, including kidnapping, rape, enslavement, torture, and murder. Escaped slaves and other Black people were not wrong to flee to Canada. It was necessary for self-preservation, born of a context in which Black people had mostly come to the Americas through the brutality of the transatlantic slave trade. Bibb’s colonizing can therefore be clearly distinguished from Europeans’ choice to become part of the colonial project. However, it complicates things that former slaves adopted the role of settler. As Sunera Thobani describes, the colonial context of Canada (and the United States) results in any settlement and citizenship being complicit in the continued dispossession of Indigenous peoples’ lands and sovereignty.196 Importantly, she notes this complicity alongside a careful study of the racism experienced by racialized immigrants in Canada, and she suggests that unless fundamental change is made at the level of what the nation is and its relationship to Indigenous communities and nations, the colonial complicity of all settlers remains an unresolvable dilemma. Mahmood says that agency lies not only in resisting social norms but also in how one inhabits norms. Whether in relation to Black women following the mores of separate spheres or escaped slaves taking up the work of colonization, clearly only so many options were available to long-denigrated peoples to enable them to survive and perform respectability. They may have reinforced oppressive mores and underlying moral economies of human value by doing what they did, but perhaps this contradiction might serve to invite us to reflect upon how each of us today uniquely inhabits oppressive mores, outside the simple framings of resistance versus complicity.197 Like many others, Bibb escaped slavery by becoming a colonizer. To complicate matters even further, the “owner” from whom he escaped was Indigenous.* Bibb wrote of his former slave master: “He was the most reasonable, and humane slaveholder that I have ever belonged to.” He wrote that he would rather be owned by an Indigenous person than a white person.198 Yet, he was nevertheless this other man’s legal property. Encouraging slave ownership was a US government tactic of assimilating Indigenous people in the South;199 it was a way Indigenous people were encouraged to inhabit “civilized” mores. Certainly, some Indigenous people having owned slaves does nothing to cancel out or trump colonial injustices. Furthermore, Indigenous nations’ responses to Black slavery were as diverse as the nations themselves. The Cherokee nation is said to have engaged in the most extensive Black slave ownership of all Indigenous groups: by the 1860s, the 17,000 members of the Cherokee nation owned 4,000 Black slaves.† The Seminole and Tuscarora nations, in contrast, provided safe haven for escaped slaves, resulting in many mixed relationships.200 Indigenous people had also been forced into slavery by Europeans and white settlers, starting with Columbus in 1492.201 Alan Gallay estimates that the British were involved in the slave trade of 30,000 to 50,000 Indigenous people in the United States by 1715.202 The practice of enslaving Indigenous people, however, was largely abandoned in the United States by 1720, in part because of militant resistance on the part of Indigenous nations.203 In telling Bibb’s story, we hope to invite consideration of just how complex these histories are, rather than point fingers here or there. Bibb was a fugitive slave who, like so many slaves, was the son of a slave mother and a white father,204 and was likely conceived through the rape of his mother. He had been owned by a First Nations man on colonized land. Bibb escaped when his Indigenous master died, and went on to become a colonizer, purchasing land from the same British Crown that had stolen the land from Indigenous peoples across what’s now called Canada and the United States. He did so to provide safe haven for other escaped slaves. Bibb was a social worker who contributed to founding an organization that helped his community secure basic freedom, education, and security. Bibb’s story illustrates the intensity with which histories of slavery, colonialism, patriarchy, and social work interlock. When this social worker intervened in one political problem that was most pressing for him, he couldn’t help but actively participate in another. Perhaps, in limitless variations, this complexity is the history of social work. Anti-Slavery Societies and Black Immigrant Assistance The earliest Black social work focused largely on assisting people who escaped slavery and fled to Canada, often with no money, no food, and no spare clothing. Rather than imagining this work to be exceptionally “particular” to Black communities and therefore irrelevant to the subsequent development of social work more generally, we should look on it as work that helped to meet the needs of a group of people who were struggling as a result of unjust social conditions (as can be said of many social workings today and in the past). There was no state assistance for fugitive slaves (with the exception of Black people who emigrated after the War of 1812 and had assisted the British forces, who were given land).205 In response to this socially constituted need, a massive voluntary effort was undertaken to assist escaped slaves, which involved Black and white people collaborating in anti-slavery and liberation societies.206 These groups helped people find jobs, provided food and other resources, and more generally did the work that would later be called social work when undertaken in an organized way within poor white migrant communities. They also crossed national boundaries, just as later professional social work would do;207 for example, the American Anti-Slavery Society sent agents across the border to Canada to assist escaped slaves.208 These organizations fostered an ethos of mutual aid. Many of the people providing and organizing support were escaped slaves who had established themselves in Canada.209 Organizations like the Fugitives’ Home and the Windsor Anti-Slavery Society were founded and run by fugitive slaves determined to assist other fugitives.210 Several were run by Black women, including the Ladies Freedman’s Aid Society, the Ladies Colored Fugitive Association, and the Toronto Ladies’ Association for the Relief of Destitute Colored Fugitives.211 Sharing the sensibility of what would soon be called social work, these organizations often believed that indiscriminate relief was bad and that aid should be restricted and controlled. For instance, the 1853 report of the Canada Anti-Slavery Society says: “All that able-bodied men and women require is a fair chance, friendly advice, and a little encouragement, perhaps a little assistance at first. Those who are really willing to work can procure employment in a short time after their arrival.”212 While the fugitive relief effort was carried out on a massive scale, individual aid was often restricted, due to prevalent discourses of liberalism, capitalism, and scientific charity. It also bears repeating, yet again, that such relief efforts later run by white people for recent immigrants from Europe is called the origin of social work. Social Services A number of social work and social service projects were organized by members of Black communities in order to assist others in their communities. While some white people were also involved in helping escaped slaves, charitable and social services were segregated in Canada. Edward Lee and Ilyan Ferrer describe “systemic exclusion from white social work institutions” for the Black community.213 They also argue that “the exclusionary logic of the colour line was reflective of how communities of colour were racially segregated within the Canadian urban geography and provides further explanation as to why they were unable to access the white dominant charity or social settlement movements.” The community building, aid, organizing, and advocacy that Black people did (and continue to do) are very clearly within the realm of what is considered social work, even though it has not been recognized as such in social work history: Elizabeth Jackson Shadd Shreve travelled through Southern Ontario forests to visit sick people and deliver food and clothing to those without;214 and Black people created youth groups, housing cooperatives, and political organizations like the Nova Scotia Association for the Advancement of Coloured People and the National Black Coalition in Nova Scotia.215 Benevolence clubs were also an important site of social service delivery and community building. One of the most prominent was called the True Band Society, which organized to create Black community self-sufficiency.216 The first True Band was founded in Amherstburg, Ontario (near Windsor), in 1854.217 Like the Provincial Union Association founded the same year, it worked to create and support Black community self-sufficiency.218 The True Bands provided resources to poor Black families, provided care for sick people, supported schools, and worked to resolve conflicts among community members.219 By 1856, there were

University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division. Edição do Kindle. fourteen True Band organizations with 600 members.220 Both the Provincial Union and the True Bands formed out of critiques about the work of groups like the Refugee Home Society and people like Henry Bibb. They considered the raising of funds and supplies from white people to be shameful, and they wanted Black communities to be self-sufficient. They also opposed the construction of Black settlements, calling for people to integrate into Canadian society. One of the strongest voices against collecting resources (“begging,” as they called it) was Mary Ann Shadd Cary, who was active in Black community social services and media.221 Black communities also built formal institutions modelled after those imported from Europe through colonialism.222 For example, Nova Scotian orphanages and children’s homes wouldn’t admit Black children – resulting in them sometimes being put in asylums or on work farms.223 Therefore, under the leadership of James R. Johnston and the African United Baptists Association, the Nova Scotia Home for Coloured Children (NSHCC) opened in 1921.224 Due to systemic racial segregation in social services,225 this institution was incredibly important to the Black community. Its opening marked the largest gathering of Black people in Nova Scotia since 1783.226 The NSHCC is an example of the social work initiatives that Black communities undertook in Canada. Candice Roker discusses the “positive survival” resistance to racist exclusion of Black people in Nova Scotia. She argues that the creation of the NSHCC “is one of the most public examples of the African Nova Scotian community taking care of its own.”227 The NSHCC retained its historical name but became racially integrated in the 1970s;228 it continued to operate as an orphanage until the late 1980s.229 Like so many institutions that house vulnerable children, including Indian residential schools and many institutions for disabled children,230 significant abuses took place at the NSHCC. In 1948, a social worker documented concerns about inadequate food for the children living in the NSHCC. Sexual abuse was documented in the 1980s, including the rape of a child, but no charges were ever laid.231 In 2001, a number of former residents of the home filed lawsuits for abuse,232 some of which dates back to as early as the 1940s.233 In 2014, the premier of Nova Scotia apologized for the abuse as part of a settlement with survivors, and a restorative inquiry was announced in 2015.234 Terrible things happened at this institution that should never happen to anyone. It is entirely possible abuse was present there from its early days. Yet, even then, we can hold this injustice in tension with an acknowledgment of the importance of what the Nova Scotian Black community did by building the home. Building a racially segregated institution, which seems to have been characterized by the same abuses of power as were found at other institutional sites, can be conceptualized as yet another instance of navigating the norms that were available at the time. Black Nova Scotians built for their community’s children a resource often considered at that time indispensable for serving children in need. As in so many other institutions, many children were seriously harmed within its walls. There is frequently a tendency to view historical developments as either good or bad, but removing the NSHCC from “good” anti-racist history and placing it into “bad” institutional history prevents us from struggling to cultivate a complex relationship with this fundamentally interlocking history and its legacies. Black communities navigated available norms, but didn’t adopt all available norms. As a glaring example with tremendous relevance to contemporary social work, we found no historical record of any Black community in the United States or Canada establishing a child protection agency in which people from outside a family or community scrutinized parents and determined whether a child would be allowed to remain with them. In the extensive social welfare systems created by Black folks in Canada and the United States, we found no evidence of a single Black agency that practised involuntary child apprehension. White child protection agencies didn’t normally* serve Black families until the end of legal racial segregation in the mid-twentieth century. Yet, even in cities with significant Black social welfare infrastructures, including women’s clubs, settlement houses, and orphanages, it seems that no Black community practised child apprehension. (If we’re wrong and one or two communities did so, it would have been extremely marginal considering that we’ve encountered no trace of it.) Black and white social workers learned from one another and often worked together, developing similar (usually racially segregated) services, but Black social workers didn’t practice child apprehension. In the only article we found exploring the fact that professional child welfare didn’t operate in US Black communities until after legal racial segregation was abolished,† Jillian Jimenez writes: “A shadow child welfare system [existed] that performed similar functions to the public child welfare system from which African American children were largely excluded.”235 In apparently every Black community, people were left to do the work of “child protection” and “child welfare” using means that had been available to them before anybody had ever become a paid “social worker.” In a recent interview about having won the Woman of Distinction Award, Black Canadian politician Zanana Akande was asked where her ethic of “continuing to push” for justice originated. In her answer, she described the informal “social workers who weren’t social workers” who collectively raised her when she was growing up in downtown Toronto in the 1940s and ’50s: “That [ethic] comes from where I was born and the people around me – the first social workers who weren’t social workers, because we were all raised collectively by our parents and by anyone else who happened to walk down the street and see us – that you must speak out, you must take care of each other, and you must push for what you want.”236 In Black communities prior to the end of racial segregation and the introduction of child protective agencies into Black communities, practices, norms, and mores were in place to protect children from violence, respond to tragedies such as parental death, and so on. “Children routinely lived with grandparents not only in the case of death, but when one or both parents left the local area to look for work … [and] children with no family would be taken in by unrelated adults in the neighbourhood who did not have children.”237 Resonant practices have existed in all communities at all times, varying significantly from place to place. Jimenez traces these specific Black child welfare practices to West African traditions of extended kinship and communal care for children, as well as to strategies later developed in response to the violences of slavery – in which Black children and adults were kidnapped, forcibly separated from one another, and held as white people’s property. In the first half of the twentieth century in Black communities in the United States, the principal strategy for protecting children from abuse and neglect was community surveillance: “the extended family, especially grandmothers … aunts, great aunts, and older sisters … provided a concentric circle of approval and disapproval to support or criticize the child rearing practices of a child’s primary caretakers.”238 There were community-sanctioned interventions for when adults harmed children, which were rooted in community-specific hierarchies of moral and political authority. Older women relatives in Black America occupied the role only then being taken over in white America by paid ruling class strangers. One practice is a violent imposition, and the other assumes communities are capable of healing and protecting themselves; both are specific and situated means of social working to keep children safe from abuse and neglect. A very different child protection system would be in place today if families and communities were imagined capable of protecting and caring for their own children, rather than assuming the state and its professionals must do so. As a consequence of racist laws and mores, Black families were fortunate to rarely have their children apprehended by state authorities during the first half of the twentieth century. Instead, they carried on and internally adapted long-standing traditions of child protection and care. The earliest white child protection agencies were born at a time of normalized extreme anti-Black violence. Black childrearing practices at the time therefore explicitly sought to prevent children from exposing themselves to the normative violences of white supremacy;239 we can imagine the devastation that might have resulted had Black families become targeted by white social work. Black families worked to protect Black children from abusive parents and also from white supremacy. Their efforts were central to Black child protection during a time of widespread lynching and other explicit anti-Black violence. Such child protection isn’t normatively validated as “social work.” Of all the diverse and significant Black interventions into the social world for over a century, from slavery liberation societies through to the civil rights movement of the mid-twentieth century, there seems to have been a consensus that the approach to “child protection” taken for granted among white ruling classes wasn’t morally or politically acceptable. No matter how one is positioned in relation to these histories, this wholesale rejection is an astounding fact for us all to seriously reflect upon today. Class Stratification and How It Interlocked with Racism and Social Work As with white social workers, Black social workers in the United States and Canada tended to be upper or middle class people assisting poor people. Class divisions among Black people, however, had different effects and significance from those among white people, given that segregation and racism had a levelling effect on Black communities. No matter how much money you had, you often could not live in a ruling class neighbourhood if you were Black, nor was it easy to get a loan, be free from the threat of racist violence, go many places, or do many other things available to white people. Class status did not inoculate against racism. Carlton-LaNey writes, “There was very little physical, social and economic distance” between those doing early Black social work and others in the communities where they worked. They “lived in the same communities and by virtue of race shared many of the same societal problems and issues of concern.” However, those “who engaged in the emerging social work profession were among the … educated elite of the African American community.”240 Educated Black women primarily provided social services,241 which could have perpetuated white ruling class social mores. Yet, Carlton-LaNey asserts that “lower class women were also active in clubs and formed organizations in an effort to serve themselves and the needy in their communities.”242 She writes that this class diversity among workers, as well as shared experiences of racism, helped these social workers more reflexively consider their own power: even educated Black social workers with “property ownership, poise, and eloquence … [were often] treated like ‘washerwomen’ [which] … kept them attuned to the deplorable conditions to which their less-fortunate sisters were subjected.”243 Through to the 1920s, “a white woman in Halifax looking for help with her laundry felt free to stop any African-Nova Scotian woman on the street and request ‘where she could get a good girl.’”244 White supremacy served to homogenize Blackness so that, in practice, it was the only relevant identifier in many cases, or at least it was the identity category that trumped all others. The assumption that any Black person would know where to get a cleaner in Halifax was based on the pervasive white supremacist association of Black people with domestic service and dirt. This thinking had important social significance and was intimately tied up with interlocking moral economies of human value. At this time, eugenics was often referred to as “mental hygiene,”245 and Ivory Soap boasted about its ability to “civilize” Indigenous people.246 This period was also the era in which white ruling class women acquired an unprecedented degree of exalted bourgeois subjectivity. Fellows and Razack explain that dirt was important in constituting these select women as separate and distinct from – and to imagine themselves morally superior to – “washerwomen.”247 The renegotiation of white ruling class women’s positioning within largely unchanged moral economies of human value relied on the intensive and ongoing discursive denigration of others. Remaining racially devalued even with upward class mobility, Black social workers’ experiences of continued discrimination, alongside the relative class diversity among Black service providers, seems to have mitigated the classism normally inherent to social work. Most Black women welfare reformers, according to Gordon, “were usually newly middle-class, perhaps a generation away from slavery and without much cushion against economic misfortune.”248 These women were living a very different experience of being middle class than that of their white contemporaries.

University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division. Edição do Kindle. contemporaries.249 Knupfer, in describing the Phyllis Wheatley Club in Chicago, therefore makes the case that “because club women were well aware of the double burden of racism and sexism which all African-American women faced, more often than not they reached ‘across’ rather than ‘down’ to their less fortunate sisters.”250 The club’s social work was “mutual and reciprocal” between poor and middle class members.251 In addition to sharing experiences of anti-Black oppression, Carlton-LaNey notes that shared Black pride also “served as a mechanism for group solidarity and helped to undercut class differences.”252 It seems that race mitigated the class oppression that early Black social workers exercised, as compared to white social work at the time. However, other scholars cite historical evidence of overt and insidious classism among Black social workers too. Many of the class biases that existed in the work of friendly visitors and other white charity work were also present among Black social work organizations. For example, urban Northern social workers who provided social services to migrants from the South often looked down upon the people they were trying to help. Martin and Martin say that Black social workers, like other urban Northern Americans, perceived the migrants as “uncouth, unkempt, boisterous, and ignorant.”253 Northern urban social workers, Black and white, therefore engaged in what Sheila Weiss calls an “effort of the middle class to mold the behavior of the migrants in its own image [which] was clearly a one-way process. There was never any hint that the black bourgeoisie had anything to learn from its newly arrived neighbors.”254 Like many other well-meaning people working to affect social change, then and now, early Black social workers often seem to have believed they knew what was best for the people they worked with. But their ideas were often informed by classist moral economies. This classed outlook was evident, for example, when Black professor R.L. Smith of Oakwood, Texas, began community organizing to make his community more aesthetically pleasing in 1889.255 As a ruling class man, he understood the physical appearance of the village to be its most pressing need. It was only after a year, when only minor issues had been resolved and people didn’t follow through on more major and expensive undertakings, that he began to wonder why the response had been so lukewarm. He realized it was because the people he was working with were poor. He concluded that “what the Negro farmers of Texas and of the South really needed was not, at this stage, a Village Improvement Society.”256 If Smith had facilitated a conversation about what the community needed and how it should go about achieving those needs at the initial meeting a year earlier, their efforts may have been much more productive. Having largely done nothing for the first year, Smith now set out to reduce poverty, alongside his own aim of getting people to improve their homes and yards. He helped organize a cooperative in which farmers in the area pooled their resources, enabling two important changes: buying in bulk (obtaining discounts for volume purchases) and avoiding the use of credit, which could mean substantial savings in interest payments. After the organization had been somewhat successful in helping farmers gain financial security, an organization called the Negro Cooperative Society was founded. Smith was a supporter of the Booker T. Washington – or liberal, rather than radical – school of Black activism, and he tied the ranks in the organization to how much people had saved. Only once someone achieved the twelfth degree, and was thus named “Grand Patriarch,” did they gain a vote at conference.257 The richest members of the cooperative society were granted exclusive voting rights, enabling them to direct the society regardless of support from its majority. Class hierarchy and bias drove this organizational design in a clear illustration of the material effects of moral economy: those already regarded superior tend to accumulate further moral (and thus political) capital. It’s assumed that those who have saved the most money are most deserving and will know best. From there, a structure is built that allows those with the most political and moral capital to gain even more institutional political power – even in this “cooperative.” Indeed, a large cross-section of Black social workers supported Booker T. Washington’s principles, which “measure success by the ownership of land, homes, businesses, union membership, and bank accounts.”258 The class status of most Black social workers, like most social workers in general, informed their values and understandings of the world. According to Peebles-Wilkins and Francis, “These women’s ideals were [ruling class] American ideals.”259 They accepted the dominant views of society, working to reform some systems of oppression while leaving others intact – especially capitalism. Peebles-Wilkins and Francis suggest that Black upwardly mobile social workers, such as Mary Church Terrell, “espoused fundamental, traditional American values about family, the work ethic, social obligations, democracy, and freedom that she transmitted cross-culturally.” They write: “The goals of black women activists focused on uplift and contained the overtones of social Darwinism,” which was the assumed social good of unimpeded competition within existing social and political structures.260 Many Black social workers, like white ones, upheld capitalism, which, after all, was the economic system permitting their upward mobility. They worked towards cumulative individual racial uplift within the parameters of existing economic and moral systems, rather than working to overhaul the system for the benefit of those suffering the most from it. Many social workers, informed by liberal individualism and prevalent moral economies of race and class differentiation, directed their change efforts at individuals rather than the social structures that caused such differentiation. Cornelius Bynum reports that “African American elites largely accommodated white racist assumptions about black inferiority.”261 Martin and Martin suggest that established residents of the urban North “feared that the newcomers would reinforce stereotypes of black people and stir up antiblack sentiments that would have dire consequences for all black people.”262 While social workers worked to “help” poor people, they also often worked to normalize and assimilate members of the Black community so that – like white ruling class women – they too might gain what Fellows and Razack call a toehold on respectability.263 When social workers did explicitly set out to address systemic issues, they became burnt out, claim Martin and Martin. As a result, in the end, “they focused their attention on trying to change the character of the victims of the dominant system, helping them to cope better with their oppression.”264 Social work interventions were frequently about normalizing poor Black people and getting them to conform to middle class behaviours, aesthetics, and values.265 This form of social work involved many of the same interventions that the friendly visitors stressed: cleanliness, good housekeeping, temperance, thrift, and so on. The 1921 report of Cincinnati’s Negro Civic Welfare Committee of the Council of Social Agencies demonstrates that the committee was incredibly condescending and paternalistic towards working class people and enacted capitalist indoctrination. The committee operated a workplace friendly visiting program involving over 800 Black women. “She goes and gives friendly advice on punctuality, regularity, efficiency, thrift, and tries to develop in them the proper attitude toward their work.”266 This committee may well have advocated for workers, and the citation above may have been written to attract donations. Yet, the report depicts this social work organization as working to improve people’s lives by helping them transform into more productive capitalist subjects, something that did nothing to improve the institutionalized social, economic, political, and moral barriers they experienced. We’re not saying that any of the work of early Black social workers shouldn’t have been done. Rather, we can all uniquely interrogate the complexities of the past in order to better understand and interrupt patterns we may continue to replicate, uniquely positioned as each one of us is within these legacies. As bell hooks says, “Interlocking systems [of oppression] indict us all in some way.”267 Early Women Social Workers and Gender Roles Working to ameliorate some of the harshness caused by capitalism while upholding the system itself is similar to how many early women social workers – Black and white – approached gender. Separate spheres discourse was incredibly oppressive for women. Yet, its specific contours and divisions also created possibilities for women to take up leadership roles in what came to be called social work. Women encroached into public spaces by intervening into others’ private spheres. As is true of all communities, Black women responded to gendered expectations in diverse ways. Mary Church Terrell, the honorary lifetime president of the National Association of Colored Women (NACW), largely supported separate spheres.268 However, Maggie Walker was adamantly and publicly opposed to separate spheres. Writing in 1912, she argued: “There is neither justice or good common sense in the demand that every woman should confine her activities to the domestic duties of home . . . As ability, adaptability decide these things for men, so let them decide for woman.”269 Walker, the first woman bank president in the United States, supported equal rights for women, which included for her the abolition of the mores of gendered separate spheres. Furthermore, regardless of their own navigation of separate spheres, many early Black social workers advocated for suffrage and gender equality,* including Mary Ann Shadd Cary,270 Mary Church Terrell, Ida B. Wells-Barnett,271 and Maggie Walker.272 Women exposed themselves to the risks of men’s patriarchal moralizing when they became active in the public sphere. For example, Henry Bibb said of Mary Ann Shadd Cary’s disagreement with him about how the community should fund a school that her outspokenness “will add nothing to her credit as a lady.”273 Yee explains: “[W]hile Black women’s participation in community-building may have been considered an acceptable extension of women’s domestic responsibility beyond the private household, those who did so found themselves in a delicate balancing act.”274 If Black women social workers were too outspoken, their femininity and precarious toehold on respectability could be questioned – within a patriarchal understanding in which femininity and outspokenness were antithetical. Subjugated Community-Based Social Workings Beyond Black and White The relatively large number of Black people in what’s now called Canada and the United States up to the periods we’re discussing is a direct result of the transatlantic slave trade. The relatively small number of migrants from Asia and other parts of the world – through to the 1960s – is a direct result of exclusionary racist immigration policies. Due to these two white supremacist practices, there were many more Black people in what’s now called the United States and Canada than any other racialized groups from the Global South. However, some people from Asia and other parts of the world did migrate here. As in Black and white communities, these communities also came together in new ways to meet needs that resulted from the massive demographic shifts occurring. Most of these communities’ efforts have not been as extensively documented as those in white and Black communities, making tracing their histories difficult; but this scarce documentation doesn’t mean they weren’t actively involved in the diverse activities of social working. Some research exists on the Chinese community in British Columbia (BC). During the era when professional social work was born, Chinese folks in BC “organiz[ed] a remarkable number of voluntary mutual aid fraternal associations, partly in response to the racial discrimination they suffered,” beginning soon after they first arrived in Canada in the late 1850s.275 These groups organized to fight racism, provide social services within their own community, and facilitate conflict resolution. Mutual aid groups operated in Chinese communities in BC for about a century, and were integral to the community in the face of the tremendous racist hostilities that surrounded them.276 Around the same time, the Sikh community in BC worked collectively with other South Asians to provide food, housing, and jobs for those in need; lobby the government; and fight discrimination. Today, we would call this collection of activities “newcomer settlement social work,” and it’s basically exactly what white and Black social workers were providing and calling social work at the time. In 1907, the Vancouver Khalsa Diwan Society was established as a Sikh religious organizing body, but, according to Norman Buchignani, Doreen Indra, and Ram Srivastava, it “quickly involved itself in matters of general [South Asian] community welfare and became the focal point for subsequent South Asian battles against discrimination.”277 While the initial group was Sikh, it is said to have “spoke[n] for all South Asian

Canadians regardless of religion.”278 Because of this inclusivity, “South Asian Muslims and Hindus … contributed money and labour to building the Vancouver Sikh temple, for they saw it as a secular rallying point for everyone from ‘Hindustan.’”279 Together, they organized against British imperial rule in South Asia and Canadian government plans to deport South Asians.280 “Over the next ten years South Asians battled continuously against racial subordination. In the process they developed a set of community institutions that were remarkable given the circumstances.”281 Diverse Indigenous nations and communities were also actively social working throughout this period. Folks drew on long-standing traditions of mutual aid and resisted the ongoing colonial project, which specifically aimed at displacing cultural practices of sharing and helping by imposing capitalist economic systems onto Indigenous nations. In these circumstances, working against colonialism to fight assimilation and preserve traditions of helping were important interventions into the social world.282 Other Indigenous interventions into the social world at the time, which fall outside the standard account of social work history, are the many ways that parents, elders, and community members organized to prevent their children from being apprehended by the state and tried to incite change when they heard about the abuse their children were subjected to.283 The centrality of the conflict between Richmond and Addams has become standard in envisioning what social work was, is, and can be. Yet, situating the conflict between the “child protection” efforts of Indigenous families, on the one hand, and the “child protection” work of Indian residential schools and children’s aid societies, on the other hand, as another way of thinking about the parameters and possibilities of social work would open up very different understandings of what “social work” is and can be. Recently, Indigenous practices such as restorative justice are beginning to be incorporated into contemporary professional social work.284 But, as we make such much-needed changes, we should be careful to avoid telling accounts of social work history that minimize the violence with which such practices have been – and continue to be – displaced and supplanted with traditions and practices from Europe and white settler communities. Recognition of that violent suppression is part of the work of decolonization too. We also need to be cautious about exactly how Indigenous practices and traditions get incorporated. As Chris has written of their work in a colonial and disablist institution that “incorporated the medicine wheel and a talking feather into our life-skills curricula,” these inclusions were never permitted to interfere with institutional efficiency and violence. They “were removed from their original contexts and pasted into our institutional one, redeployed in such a way as to extend the status quo operations of institutionalization and enculturation.”285 Indigenous practices can be significant in the shift towards more just and dignified possible ways for humans to come together in what is called social work,286 as can the work of countless other communities that have had their practices displaced, marginalized, and subjugated by professional social work. However, these practices should never be cut and pasted into otherwise unchanged white social work. Rather, we need to fundamentally transform the narrow and hierarchical norms and mores that are now institutionalized. The history we provide in this chapter is nowhere near complete. The diversity of examples of social work that sprang up in response to specific community concerns around the turn of the last century exceeds the number of communities that existed at the time. Social work in distinct communities looked different from one another because those communities, and their beliefs, needs, and resources, were different from one another. Such diversity – then and now – could function as an important resource for social workers today, but only if we know to look for it at all. Conclusion We have given a brief overview of early social work in the United States and Canada, focusing on Black social work because of the existing scholarship on the breadth of activities and the obvious erasures of sometimes identical activities as those included within white social work history. Presumably, like the majority of those in the helping professions today, most Black social workers at the time worked largely out of the public eye, and so their contributions will forever remain unknown to history. Community organizing and social movements are made up of many people who all make important contributions, but when these activities are recorded in history, the collectivities get translated through individualism into remarkable heroes who bravely led the way.287 This tendency alone, though, doesn’t account for why so little is known within social work scholarship about Black community and social service work a century ago. Many Black leaders – such as Wells, Du Bois, and Walker – were famous around 1900 for their many interventions into the social world. And, of course, we’ve clearly left countless other well-known Black figures out of this history. It’s simply untrue that social work emerged only out of British and white settler efforts, as the standard account would have it. Yet, that false history continues to have concrete effects today. Because the standard account is told the way it is, radical social work scholar Mimi Abramovitz can critique that, due to “racism and segregation, the settlements and the networks established by African American women never became well known or exercised much influence outside the African American community.”288 While this assessment is not entirely untrue, it erases what influence they did have and the prominence some historical Black folks held, and it doesn’t consider whether white folks like Addams might have been directly influenced by the sometimes earlier Black efforts. Yet, what is perhaps even more troubling is that Abramovitz can acknowledge the influence of racism and still also write, as a summary of “the history of social work,” that the “social change-oriented Settlement House Movement (SHM) vied for control of the emerging profession with the older and more individually oriented Charity Organization Society (COS). This initial conflict … anticipated a century of struggle.”289 We are struck by the incongruity of adding the fact that racism shaped history to that very tradition of history without reshaping the priorities which inform its telling as a result of this fact. Social work struggles with personal versus political change, certainly, but why should that particular conflict be the guiding framework for all social work history? Or why should that struggle be represented by the COS versus white settlements? Another history of social work could present the primary tension as that of the liberal Booker T. Washington camp versus the radical W.E.B. Du Bois camp, or the liberal Maggie Walker camp versus the radical Ida B. Wells camp. Like centring the conflict between Richmond and Addams, these framings would describe the tension between advocating for reform within a largely unchanged system versus working to fundamentally transform the system. Even more transformative, as suggested earlier, would be if we honoured the “child protection” work done in Black communities with no institutionalized child protective services, alongside that done in Indigenous communities struggling to save their children from externally imposed professional “protection,” and we took such widely diverse work as a counterpoint to the work that became institutionalized as white child protective services and Indian residential schooling. This ongoing struggle of communities taking care of their own versus external imposition is a fundamental tension that has always existed in “social work practice” – and honouring or centring it might significantly shift the ways we think and feel about what we do. Maybe it would even transform what we tend to do. In their history of what they call “radical social work,” Michael Reisch and Janice Andrews discuss some of the work of Black organizers during the Progressive Era. However, they repeatedly make white people the reference point. For example, they write: “Some early radical social workers were far more willing than their mainstream counterparts to work cooperatively with people of color and to participate in inter-racial organizations or multiracial coalitions.”290 Here, the category “radical social workers” is represented as white. They go on to mention the work of (unnamed) Black women organizers and then emphasize Jane Addams’s role in anti-racist organizing. Such representations continue to inform imaginaries of who (radical) social workers are today. While American histories of Black social work are much more concrete and accessible than Canadian ones,291 plenty of interventions into the social world in 1800s Black Ontario and Nova Scotia are well documented. These stories are not entirely hidden – the work of anti-slavery societies and Black colonizers are often disseminated during Black History Month. The opening of the Nova Scotia Home for Coloured Children brought out the biggest gathering of Black Nova Scotians in over a century,292 and one of its founders, James Johnston, had the largest funeral in Halifax since the death of Sir John S.D. Thompson, Canada’s fourth prime minister, two decades earlier.293 These events were not marginal. How do they become and remain marginal stories when history gets written? Black social workers were clearly influenced by what was going on in white social work.294 Without a doubt, that’s true. But white social workers were also influenced by Black social workers,295 and this reciprocity isn’t acknowledged in the standard account. Most of the histories of Black social work we’ve drawn upon make mention of white social work, especially of Jane Addams and her work.296 Racialized social work authors are required to demonstrate their fluency in white social work history, but white social work historians don’t need to prove their credentials in relation to Black histories or any other histories outside of white settler and European communities. This double standard is due to the moral economy of white supremacy continuing to shape what gets known and done. Discussing Black social work educator and social worker George Haynes’s view that Black social workers needed to learn Black history, Martin and Martin write that Haynes felt Black people are “both creatures and creators of history in that history has placed them where they are right now and has shaped their point of view, their identity, and their aspirations.”297 This description is particularly true of Black people in the context of white supremacist American and Canadian history, but it can also be said to be true in site-specific ways for all of us. We are all “creatures and creators of history”; history shapes what we can think, perceive, feel, do, and be – not only because of which past events occurred, but also because of which past events get told, how they’re framed, from whose perspective they’re told, and who gets represented as significant in their development. The exclusion of Black and racialized social workers from the standard account of social work history is a product of white supremacy, and it replicates social work as a white institution, naturalizing white people in the role of social worker and making social workers of colour seem aberrational even today. Histories centre certain figures and decentre others. Addams, a white woman, is centred while Wells and Walker are decentred. This act of narrative exaltation and marginalization has real consequences. Consider the following: Karen Lundblad writes, “As a social reformer and organizer, Addams is almost unparalleled … [and] remains an inspiration and role model for social workers today.”298 We admire Addams for her work and her mind. She is indeed an inspiration. Yet, what does it mean to frame her as “almost unparalleled” if we consider the Black women who fought for social change, benefited their communities, and contributed to the helping professions as a whole? Further salt is added to the wound when claims of Addams’s uniqueness are evidenced by her relationship with Wells, Du Bois, and other Black activists. What’s forgotten is that she gravitated to them as inspirational, at the very same time as they gravitated to her. She wasn’t the only inspiration in those relationships. And she doesn’t have to be the only one available to us today.
