In the years following the Montgomery bus boycott,  several streams of Black activism fundamentally transformed the conscious ness and practices associated with anti-Black racism and white supremacy in  the United States and Canada. However problematically, most people know this  history as represented through the lives of two individual Black men: Martin  Luther King Jr and Malcolm X. Patriarchy, liberal individualism, and binary  thinking shape the story of two exceptional individual men representing oppos \ning poles, as if this framing accurately accounts for the entire complexity and  diversity of anti-racist struggle at the time.218 But we can nevertheless take their  lives and work as points of reference, given that readers will likely have some  familiarity with them. For example, when we write that Martin Luther King Jr  delivered the \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech in 1963,219 we anticipate that many read \ners will know of this speech and its enduring significance. That shared knowl edge will help to ground readers\u2019 understanding of what we say from there.  The very next year several significant things happened in relation to anti-Black  racism and anti-racist struggle: King won the Nobel Peace Prize220 (showing  how well established his activism was by this time); Malcolm X completed the  Hajj to Mecca, delivered his speech \u201cThe Ballot or the Bullet,\u201d and began to  distance himself from the Nation of Islam (NOI)221 (signifying that he\u2019d already  done the majority of the significant interventions into the social world he\u2019s most  widely remembered for as a member of the NOI); and the US Congress passed  the Civil Rights Act, which banned discrimination based on race.222 All these  Copyright \u00a9 2019. University of Toronto Press. All rights reserved.\nthings happened in 1964. But the year 1964 was also the year that the Africville  relocation began.223 It didn\u2019t begin previous to civil rights struggle. By the time the last Africville resident had been removed from his home,  both King and Malcolm X had been assassinated.224 Therefore, every word  either one spoke that has ever been represented in a film, a song, a T-shirt, or  an email signature had already been spoken by the time Africville was finally  emptied of its residents and bulldozed. The demolition was not a relic of the  overtly racist pre\u2013civil rights era.",

As a result, Addams said, she \u201cdiscovers how incor rigibly bourgeois her standards have been, and it takes but a little time to reach  the conclusion that she cannot insist so strenuously upon the conventions of  her own class.\u201d97 Interestingly, Addams articulated these various critiques of the  COS and its work within her conceptualization of a radical view of democracy.  For Addams, democracy goes well beyond \u201ca sentiment which desires the well being of all\u201d or a \u201cbelie[f] in the essential dignity and equality of all.\u201d98 Democ racy, she said, also demands \u201ca rule of living\u201d from each of us, by which \u201call must  turn out for one another, and at least see the size of one another\u2019s burdens.\u201d99 What she called democratic or \u201csocial ethics\u201d relies upon being exposed to the  real-life experiences of one another. She claimed that the \u201cdemocratic spirit \u2026  implies that diversified human experience and resultant sympathy \u2026 are the  foundation and guarantee of Democracy.\u201d100 Addams promoted a democracy  that recognizes inequality, difference, and diversity. This democracy demands  exalted people to recognize that we don\u2019t all carry the same burden or struggle,  \nand that we therefore have uneven responsibilities to address inequalities. In this and many other respects, Addams was indeed a radical. Her operation alization of \u201cdemocracy\u201d is entirely distinct from Richmond, for example, who  called it undemocratic to \u201crun howling to Washington, asking special legislation  for our troubles.\u201d101 That Richmond construed special legislation in response to  political problems as \u201cundemocratic\u201d shows yet again her consistent emphasis  on individual effort as the only acceptable means to transform society. That said, like the rest of us, Addams wasn\u2019t consistent in her political efforts.  Hull-House implemented a screening system for people applying for relief  from private charities: the Hull-House Bureau of Labour and Charitable Reg istration.102 Not very different from the COS in this regard, Addams had \u201cbeen  working since 1892 to encourage charities to systematize their relief efforts.\u201d103 Further, Margolin asserts that Addams was \u201cfar from egalitarian,\u201d in that she  advocated that ruling class folks have a duty to help poor people because of  Copyright \u00a9 2019.

Du Bois and Ida B. Wells when Booker T. Washington advocated them,127 \nbut Addams could advocate such measures without attracting critique. Addams\u2019s own copy of Washington\u2019s The Story of the Negro is on exhibit with other  selections from her personal library at the Jane Addams Hull-House Museum.  An insert inside the book reads: \u201cAlthough W.E.B. Du Bois and Washington are  remembered as leaders with different methods for advancing civil rights, their  ideas intersected at Hull-House. Du Bois spoke at Hull-House and worked with  Addams with the NAACP. Booker T. Washington influenced Addams as well.\u201d128 Addams also entertained Washington and his wife at Hull-House.129 Furthermore, settlement houses featured strong class boundaries, with poor  people often instructed by ruling class workers.130 In fact, many of the same  values and social mores that the COS imposed through friendly visiting were  also imposed on poor people in settlements. The persistence of classism, eth nocentrism, and racism in structures set up to work against class and ethnic  oppression relates to the concerns raised earlier about Addams\u2019s philosophy.  Discussing Addams, Shannon Sullivan writes: \u201cCountering asymmetries of top down power with horizontal processes of negotiation and deliberation does not  necessarily eliminate all forms of insidious hierarchy.\u201d131 Inserting reciprocity  into existing stratification does not necessarily lead to a just democracy.* People  who accessed services and programs at Hull-House were likely generally treated  with more respect than many of those visited by friendly visitors and early case workers, but class divisions and capitalism remained in place, and the ruling  class workers benefited from the moral exaltation that has long come along with  Copyright \u00a9 2019.

It\u2019s therefore easy to read this phrase many  times without knowing where it was originally spoken. \nThe first public reading and publication of Pratt\u2019s paper was at the 1892  National Conference on Charities and Corrections,180 which later became the  National Conference of Social Work. To give some context, other featured  themes included immigration, the insane, the feebleminded, and women in  philanthropy. Of these themes, apart from \u201ccharity organization,\u201d no other  theme had more than three papers devoted to it \u2013 although there was a special  tribute to influential eugenicist Oscar McCulloch, the COS leader discussed  earlier who wrote The Tribe of Ishmael181 and had recently died; four people paid  tribute to him. \u201cIndian policy\u201d had six papers devoted to it \u2013 twice as many as  any other theme apart from McCulloch\u2019s tributes and charity organization.182 Several of these Indian policy papers focused on the education of Indigenous  children. \nTo give a different kind of context, the National Conference on Charities  and Corrections directly became legitimized professional social work and is  consistently acknowledged as having done so in social work histories, however  selectively. Their 1892 program gives us a glimpse of what leaders of what was  soon called professional social work were up to at the time; yet, 1892 was also  the year that Black anti-lynching activist and social worker Ida B. Wells (dis \ncussed in chapter 2) published Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases,183 which is a very different kind of social working than that of McCulloch or Pratt.  We can just pause to consider what gets included or excluded in normative  social work history. \nWhile Pratt was not a social worker, it should be recalled that nobody had  ever called themselves or anyone else a social worker in 1892. The term didn\u2019t  exist. However, the organization through which \u201csocial work\u201d came into being  over the next decade considered Pratt one of their own.

University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division. Edi\u00e7\u00e3o do Kindle. After only three years, the Dominion WCTU had nearly 10,000 members, and in 1914 it had nearly 17,000. The WCTU in the United States was made up of autonomous local organizations, some of which were mixed race while others were racially segregated. In the South, it was commonplace to have segregated unions; generally, Black unions were called \u201cnumber two.\u201d81 Therefore, both of the following are true: white supremacy ensured that Black women were considered second class in the national unions and broader social structures;82 and Black women were active in WCTUs and made important contributions to the organization and the temperance movement more broadly.83 It is important to acknowledge the exaltation of white women in the leadership of the organization, as well as to recognize that Black women played significant roles in it. The most prominent Black woman in the WCTU was Francis Harper. She became the superintendent of Work Among the Colored People of the North in 1883, a position she held for several years. Alison Parker explains that Harper and other Black women were attracted to the WCTU because of \u201cits commitment to national legislation and federal solutions to moral and social problems in the United States.\u201d84 Harper strove towards interracial cooperation and travelled the country advocating for it within the WCTU and Black temperance activism more generally. Harper supported women\u2019s suffrage and viewed white women as important potential allies. She advocated for and had some (limited) success in having more Black representation in the national governing bodies of the WCTU.85 The WCTU and other temperance organizations did a great deal of the kinds of work that those who are credited as founding social work were also doing. Like Hull-House, the WCTU was headquartered in Chicago and did social work such as operating homes for \u201cfallen women,\u201d establishing kindergartens, providing vocational training, advocating for better care for orphaned children, engaging in prison and policing reform projects (which included calls for police matrons and forced prison labour), providing educational programs for mothers and children, and advocating for legislation reform to protect girls.86 The WCTU also worked to lay the groundwork for women to become more prominent in political reform. Significantly, Francis Willard, the long-time leader of the WCTU, called the work of the WCTU \u201csocial work.\u201d* Why then would the WCTU be left out of the standard account of social work history? Carol Mattingly posits that the WCTU is largely excluded from feminist history because of \u201ccontemporary scholars\u2019 discomfort with temperance women\u2019s religious/evangelical associations.\u201d87 This theory seems likely in relation to social work history, whether feminist or otherwise, due to the normative notion that progress over the last few centuries has mapped onto increasing secularism. From a contemporary standpoint, temperance organizing is a political anomaly: these women often used direct action protest tactics and were religious zealots. They viewed all social issues as caused by a single thing \u2013 alcohol (and sometimes other drugs like tobacco) \u2013 and they believed that eliminating this vice would solve social problems such as poverty and violence against women. Indeed, Frances Willard quoted Richard Cobden: \u201cTemperance Reform lies at the foundation of all reforms.\u201d88 Perhaps seemingly paradoxical by contemporary standards, Sharon Cook argues that the WCTU\u2019s \u201cconservative ideas of family relationships could, and did, result in progressive demands.\u201d89 As a prime example, the WCTU led what may have been the earliest mass campaign against men\u2019s violence against women and children \u2013 still a central social work issue today. The WCTU rallied around the watchword \u201chome protection,\u201d coined by Canadian WCTU leader Letitia Youmans. Willard made this watchword a guiding principle for the organization.90 Towards the end of the nineteenth century, alcohol consumption had been constructed as masculine with, according to Cook, \u201cits most destructive impact on the home and the often defenceless family.\u201d91 Alcohol was blamed for men\u2019s desertion of their wives and children, poverty, domestic violence, and sexual assault. The WCTU saw eliminating alcohol as removing the root cause of all these problems. The WCTU circulated petitions against the assault on women and girls, and the organization\u2019s members attended criminal trials in support of female victims of sexual violence. They led campaigns to raise the age of consent in the United States and Canada, and were almost always successful.92 Cook therefore writes that temperance was \u201ca \u2018constellation\u2019 issue,\u201d which included \u201cseveral associated \u2013 and ultimately more important \u2013 concerns, through which women expressed their outrage at male violence and irresponsibility, their fears for the survival of the family unit, and, eventually, their collective demands for legislative solutions to these problems.\u201d93 While blaming alcohol and other intoxicants for men\u2019s violence against women, the WCTU nevertheless also politicized violence against women as a gendered social issue and was seemingly the first large cohesive group that organized to eliminate it. As with many social workers then and now, child protection and well-being were a major WCTU concern. In addition to homes for single mothers and their children, the WCTU worked with children\u2019s aid societies to identify and assist children in need. When a child protection agency was created in Ontario, the WCTU expressed the desire to \u201cgreatly assist by recommending the names of suitable persons to help in this work.\u201d94 In the United States, the Department of Securing Homes for Homeless Children attempted to do just that. Willard wrote: \u201cCooperation with existing Children\u2019s Aid Societies is recommended \u2026 and [they] are glad to welcome us as coadjutors. It is not too much to say that the salvation of our beloved country depends upon the salvation of these children.\u201d95 The WCTU and its youth counterpart, the YWCTU, ran a number of homes for women in the United States. In Canada, Ottawa\u2019s Home for Friendless Women provided shelter for \u201cfallen women\u201d with children, teaching them parenting skills and providing them with basic necessities. In order to stay in the home, women had to agree to live there for one year or more. The program was designed to both punish and rehabilitate these women, in part through long hours of laundry work. The shelter also took in old women. Another shelter was the \u201cFrances E. Willard Home for Girls [which] was a temporary shelter for young women in Toronto founded around 1895.\u201d96 Its 1905 annual report stated: \u201cGirls coming to the city with no definite idea as to employment are counselled to go to private houses as domestics, and situations are usually found for them.\u201d97 In 1903, the Ontario WCTU noted: \u201cOwing to the ever-increasing demand for domestics the average time of the girls in Home is too short to admit of much training, nevertheless we are persuaded that through the sheltering care of the Home and its matron many a soul has been saved from degradation.\u201d98 The Ontario WCTU\u2019s annual reports from 1890 to 1926 also suggest an ongoing interest in working specifically in Black and Indigenous communities.99 While they seem to have imagined that work in Indigenous communities first required contact with white missionaries,* it appears that the position of superintendent for \u201cWork among the Colored People\u201d was inconsistently held by Black and white women.* These reports also suggest a different spin on \u201ctemperance,\u201d which makes sense given the era, but is often left out of what could perhaps be called the standard account of the WCTU. It would seem that their concern about alcohol was, at least in part, a eugenic one. As mentioned earlier, eugenicists believed that social and behavioural influences could shape biology as much as they believed that degeneracy works in the opposite direction. Drinking could thus both cause bad heredity and be caused by bad heredity. Therefore, drinking was believed to lead to many other forms of moral and physical degeneracy. Mrs E. Adelia Lucas served as superintendent of the Ontario WCTU\u2019s Department of Heredity and Hygiene. In 1890, she wrote: \u201cThe sin of bringing into the world diseased and defective children is almost unpardonable, and the sin of marrying and inebriating and having descendants tainted and switched off on to the side-track of ruin is literally a crime that can never be atoned for.\u201d100 The WCTU founded the Department of Heredity and Hygiene to investigate the eugenic causes of alcohol and tobacco consumption, which \u201cwas soon broadened, so as to include all hereditary tendencies, healthful and pure, as well as diseased conditions.\u201d Lucas maintained that these tendencies reflect \u201cone of God\u2019s primal laws for all living things.\u201d101 Her eugenic rhetoric, then, is thoroughly Christian \u2013 undermining the often-assumed analysis that what was considered science displaced religion at this \u201cprogressive\u201d time. The WCTU\u2019s Department of Heredity and Hygiene wove science into its religious world view. Anti-Lynching Lynching, the act of extralegal mob murder, became increasingly commonplace as a racialized form of violence in many parts of the United States following emancipation. Although lynching was not a new practice, for the first time in 1885 there were more lynchings of Black people than white, and this tendency persisted until around the time that Black people began to be institutionalized.102 The year-by-year statistics show a dramatic increase of lynching in general, alongside a decrease in white people who were lynched each year. When Black people were no longer considered the property of individual white people who could punish and kill them at will, mobs of white people began to increasingly murder Black people. This violence was often rationalized by claiming that they were protecting themselves or other whites (particularly the virtue of white women) from crimes committed by Black people. According to Davis, after the Civil War, \u201cwhite supremacy continued to be embraced by vast numbers of people and became deeply inscribed in new institutions. One of these post-slavery institutions was lynching, which was widely accepted for many decades thereafter.\u201d103 Lynching was brutal and torturous; it was also commonplace. A draft of a petition to the federal and state governments in 1918 describes what was going on at the time: The reported causes for such appalling brutality run the gamut from alleged violation of the honor of white women to disputing the word of white men \u2026 [However,] only about five per cent of these murders are reputed to have been inflicted upon accused violators of womanhood \u2026 [so] the desire to protect womanhood is almost negligibly among the so-called causes of lynchings \u2026 May your silence be construed as tacit approval or active tolerance of these things?104 Ida B. Wells-Barnett estimated that 10,000 Black people were lynched in the three decades following the Civil War (1865\u20131895).105 These murders were horrors on multiple levels: they targeted individuals for torture and death, affected families who were left grieving their loved ones and finding themselves in deeper poverty with the loss of their husband or father\u2019s income, and also affected entire communities, in that many Black people knew people who had been lynched or disappeared. That one could be attacked for standing up for oneself, defending oneself, or simply for being Black would have led to persistent fear in the Black community, as it was designed to do. Trigger warning: Please be advised that the following four paragraphs include graphic descriptions of lynchings. Lynchings were often conducted during the day and in public in order to maximize their impact on terrorizing Black populations and constraining them to rigidly racialized social mores. The 1918 anti-lynching petition mentioned earlier, for example, describes one lynching in which a Black man was burned at the stake and \u201can entire helpless colored population was marched around the fire, amid fumes of a burning human being and put on notice that as that black man was suffering they too should fear to suffer.\u201d106 Lynching was explicitly about keeping Black people in fear as a tactic to keep them subordinated. It secured the force of the colour line post-emancipation, socializing both white and Black people to occupy their respective stratified moral and political positions. At the height of anti-Black lynching, white people took photos of mutilated Black bodies and had them mass printed as postcards,107 which were sold at stores and sent through the US postal service.* The rise of anti-Black lynching maps neatly onto the birth and flourishing of eugenics. If not taken as mere coincidence, this intersection suggests a shift in ruling class white morality in Europe and white settler colonies where racialized, poor, disabled, and otherwise oppressed communities were being targeted for eradication in new ways. As poor and disabled white people were increasingly targeted for incarceration and reproductive,\n\nChapman, Chris; Withers, A.J..

Edi\u00e7\u00e3o do Kindle. economic, and social death, Black people were initially not incarcerated; instead they were being killed. Of the uneven relationship at the time between anti-Black lynching and disablist eugenics, one illustrative event was the murder of a \u201cseventeen year old boy by the name of Jesse Washington \u2026 in 1916,\u201d which is the year after the cornerstone eugenic criminology text, The Criminal Imbecile, was published.108 James Allen says that Jesse Washington was \u201cseriously mentally challenged. The wife of the farmer he worked for was found dead.\u201d109 Jesse was tried and convicted. From Rafter\u2019s history of eugenic criminology, we might expect that Jesse would have been given an indefinite prison sentence, resulting in a eugenically rationalized lifelong incarceration due to his intellectual disability \u2013 although in Texas, where he was killed, he may have been more likely confined to an asylum for his life. Regardless, neither of these things took place. Instead he was dragged out of the courtroom, kicked down the steps, tortured, burned alive, castrated, had his fingers cut off one by one, and hanged. \u201cThere were 16,000 people crowding the street to watch this boy be tortured \u2026 [T]here were cheers, like at a football game, cheering the torturers on.\u201d Perhaps Jesse was partly targeted because he was disabled, but he was publicly tortured and murdered because he was Black.110 Ida B. Wells-Barnett Black communities fought vigorously to abolish lynching. One of the most prominent anti-lynching activists was Ida B. Wells (Wells-Barnett,\u2020 following her marriage).111 She was also a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the National Association of Colored Women, and was active in the women\u2019s club movement. In 1884, she first gained wide recognition for refusing to move from an all-white train car and for winning a settlement against the railroad.112 Wells wrote a condemnation of lynching in Memphis\u2019s Free Speech and Headlight after her friend Tom Moss was lynched for defending himself from white men\u2019s physical attacks in 1892. Due to the response to this condemnation, she was forced to flee the South. She recalls: \u201cIt was for the assertion of this fact, in the defense of her own race, that the writer hereof became an exile; her property destroyed and her return to her home forbidden under penalty of death.\u201d113 Nevertheless, she continued to agitate against lynching. In 1899, she wrote and circulated a pamphlet, \u201cLynch Law in Georgia,\u201d to Black communities in Chicago. She wrote: \u201cThe real purpose of the savage demonstrations is to teach the Negro that in the south he has no rights that the law will enforce. Samuel House was burned to teach the Negroes that no matter what a white man does to them, they must not resist.\u201d114 In response to dominant framings of anti-Black lynching more generally, and specifically to Jane Addams\u2019s acceptance of this normative white framing in her own condemnation of lynching, Wells demonstrated that most lynchings didn\u2019t involve even a claim* that the murdered man had raped a white woman.115 She showed that many of the lynchings committed on the grounds of sexual assault by Black men against white women were actually white responses to consensual interracial relationships, which were considered unacceptable within interlocking white supremacist patriarchal moral economies.116 White men had only recently lost unmitigated sexual access to the Black women they owned in law, regardless of these women\u2019s desires and consent, with the end of slavery.117 The predominant white account of lynching at the time was that white women were regularly raped by Black men, but Andrea Smith challenges the fictitiousness of this narrative: \u201cIn fact, Black women needed protection from white men.\u201d118 Indeed, Wells-Barnett\u2019s grandmother was a slave and her father a slave-owner\u2019s son \u2013 so he was likely a child who resulted from rape, as was common during slavery.119 Although fictitious, the prevalent notion that white men had to lynch Black men in order to save white women from Black rape was so pervasive that Hollywood\u2019s first blockbuster, The Birth of a Nation, which had the highest grossing ticket sales until Gone with the Wind twenty-four years later,120 depicts what claims to be a historical account of post-Civil War reconstruction and glorifies the founding of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) and a lynching in response to a Black man raping a white woman.121 When considering the views of Smith and Wells-Barnett on lynching Black men accused of raping white women, it\u2019s important to note that white men who raped any woman of any race were never lynched. In fact, most often there was no consequence at all. Contemporary readers should remember this point if they find Wells-Barnett\u2019s handling of rape and sexual assault accusations troubling due to having been socialized within second wave feminism\u2019s crucial politicization of sexual assault and the importance of believing those who say they\u2019ve been sexually assaulted. That indispensable lesson needs to be taken into account, alongside a concern about white supremacist framings of Black and racialized men as particularly prone to rape and other patriarchal violence. Of course, even consensual relationships can involve sexual assault \u2013 a point which could be said to become lost within Wells-Barnett\u2019s claim that the issue pertains to race and not sexual assault as the (interracial) relationship was consensual. (That, said, it was not until the 1970s in the United States122 and in 1983 in Canada123 that men could be held legally responsible for raping their wives.) However, it doesn\u2019t appear Wells-Barnett believed that rape never happened. But she was fighting against the ruse by which rape (real or fictitious) was used to excuse lynching. Like many other Black feminists, Wells-Barnett understood how gender and race interlocked, and she fought against this interlocking oppression rather than against racism or sexism in isolation. Carlton-LaNey writes of such anti-lynching work, saying that Black women at the time \u201crecognize[d] the political nature of sexism long before their white counterparts.\u201d Wells-Barnett and other early Black social workers \u201cfaced the fact that sexual exploitation and violence were perpetuated by both African American and white men.\u201d Carlton-LaNey therefore argues that \u201cpoliticizing sexual exploitation and harassment for African American women placed it squarely within the context of race. Combatting sexual exploitation, therefore, was inextricably linked to race uplift.\u201d124 Early anti-racist feminism did not minimize sexism or sexual assault; rather, it politicized sexism, sexual assault, and responses to them in multiple directions. Andrea Smith begins her chapter \u201cSexual Violence as a Tool of Genocide\u201d by troubling Susan Brownmiller\u2019s second wave white feminist assertion that rape \u201cis nothing more or less than a conscious process of intimidation by which all men keep all women in a state of fear.\u201d Smith uses this statement as a springboard to explore how racism and colonialism shape the particulars of what rape is.125 Likewise, Wells-Barnett was centrally concerned with situating rape and rape discourse within what contemporary feminists call interlocking oppression, as evidenced by her repeated discussions of gender and race and, to a lesser extent, class.126 Such early anti-racist feminist understandings of interlocking oppression trouble the common history of feminism in which interlocking analyses are a recent development initiated by Black feminists such as the Combahee River Collective,127 Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw,128 Patricia Hill Collins,129 Angela Davis,130 Audre Lorde,131 and bell hooks.132 Without minimizing the importance of Black feminism since the 1970s (which often honours earlier Black feminist history), the Black feminist struggle to work against interlocking oppression goes back to the first wave of feminism, which is largely left out of white histories of feminism. It\u2019s not that we wish to reduce the importance of recent anti-racist feminist authors and activists; it\u2019s that remembering the earlier anti-racist feminists raises troubling questions about how feminism\u2019s history up to the 1970s came to be recorded as yet another white history. After fleeing the South, Wells-Barnett organized anti-lynching organizations in a number of states.133 These and other anti-lynching campaigns were hugely influential in Black communities in the United States. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) emerged from anti-lynching activists. Founded in 1909 by a mixture of some of the Black community organizers we\u2019re discussing in this chapter \u2013 Wells-Barnett, Terrell, and Du Bois \u2013 and some white activists (including Addams), the NAACP has worked for racial equality for over a century and is still active today.134 White Social Work and Anti-Lynching Addams and Wells-Barnett were contemporaries and allies in numerous political struggles.135 Although Addams was somewhat exceptional (for a white person) for her commitment to anti-racism, including her activism against lynching, she also accepted that aspects of the white supremacist connection between sexual assault and lynching were true. She was a member of the NAACP at the time, yet she felt entitled to do and say things that appear to have been unaccountable to the experiences of Black communities. According to Wilma Peebles-Wilkins and E. Aracelis Francis, Addams \u201cdid not seem to understand that lynchings involved innocent victims and were not just an unacceptable response to crime.\u201d136 Addams accepted the view that Black men posed a threat to white women and white communities, but objected to lynchings on the grounds that they were not an effective deterrent to this kind of violence and punishment for crimes should be left to the legal system. She also wrote that lynchings were effective in reducing crimes committed by Black men because \u201ccertain elements of the self can be prevented from coming into action,\u201d but pointed out that this inhibition was only a temporary fix because these \u201celements of the self\u201d might resurface.137 Addams\u2019s analysis was shaped by her whiteness and her class positioning, by moral economies of white supremacy, and by discourses stressing the importance of the rule of law and Black men\u2019s criminality. Like Addams, Willard of the WCTU also didn\u2019t understand that lynching was used to control and terrorize Black people. The WCTU refused to allow Wells to address its annual national assembly in 1893. The following year, Wells secured the sponsorship of an organization to ensure that she could address the meeting. She wanted to confront the WCTU\u2019s failure to publicly condemn the lynching of Black men.138 Wells\u2019s insistence on confronting Willard and the WCTU was provoked by an 1890 interview in which Willard made several racist comments about Black people. Willard\u2019s remarks included reiterating the notion that Black men pose a threat to the safety of women and children. She said of white Southerners: \u201cThe problem in their hands is immeasurable. The colored race multiplies like the locusts of Egypt. The grog-shop [liquor store] is a center of power. The safety of women, of childhood, of the home is menaced.\u201d139 Willard thus reiterated the frequent justification of lynching due to the supposed threat that Black men posed to white women. It is particularly concerning that one of the earliest organizations combatting violence against women reified the idea that Black men were exceptionally violent towards women and failed to condemn the racist violence of lynching. When Wells identified Willard\u2019s position as untrue and racist, Willard defended her position. However, she added: I wish I had said then, as I do now, that the immoralities of white men in their relations with colored women are the source of intolerable race prejudice and hatred, and that there is not a more withering curse upon the manhood of any nation than that which the eternal laws of nature visited upon those men in those homes in which the helpless bondwoman was made the victim of her master\u2019s base desire.140 While Willard continued to claim that Black men posed a sexual threat to white women and girls, she attempted to soften her claims with the acknowledgment that white men also posed a threat to Black women and girls. But, as Mattingly observes, Willard\u2019s condemnation of white men was \u201csituated primarily in the past and associated with the evils of slavery.\u201d141 In effect, Willard was saying that white men may have once posed a threat to Black women and girls, but now it is only Black men who are still dangerous. In response to building pressure, including the condemnation of the WCTU by other prominent Black social justice organizers, the WCTU passed a resolution against lynching in 1895. The resolution stated defensively that the WCTU \u201cought never to have been placed in the position of having to defend themselves from the charge that they favored the lynching of any human being, anywhere, under any circumstances.\u201d142 It also claimed that people \u201cmisrepresented our position,\u201d likely referring to Wells, Ransom, and others who demanded that the WCTU actively and publicly condemn lynching. Coming across this story from about 120 years ago, we recognize the still all-too-familiar pattern within social justice work\n\nChapman, Chris; Withers, A.J..

Rather than deeply reflecting on her position, this white person in a leadership position, and the organization under her direction, dug in their heels and refused to acknowledge the harm they\u2019d caused. The white people thus claimed their own innocence143 and, worse still, depicted themselves as wronged for having been accused of racism. The implication is that the Black community organizers who challenged the organization\u2019s position were overreacting, too sensitive, and too angry \u2013 all of which reaffirms white supremacist anti-Black stereotypes. For this reason, these stories of Wells, Willard, and Addams are not only important as history but also as examples of how people today who claim to be allies need to be reflexive and of when they should defer to the lead of those most directly affected by an issue. Our aim here, with respect to Addams and Willard, is to paint a more complex picture of them \u2013 particularly of Addams. We\u2019re all formed by discourses, practices, and moral economies of interlocking oppression. They shape what we can know, believe, and perceive. It\u2019s not that this shaping is out of the realm of our influence or that either woman is innocent. Recognizing these complexities and holding their positive anti-oppressive practice in tension with the clearly racist, classist, and otherwise oppressive things they did is useful in helping us all understand that we\u2019re complicit in oppression even when working against it. Acknowledging this complicity is a crucial part of critical or anti-oppressive practice.144 Early Black social workers were not perfect either. Like everyone else, they were flawed people with imperfect politics who sometimes did oppressive things and often held problematic views about other people. They were part of the project of social work\u2019s new and politically complicated interventions into the social world, and sometimes this project brought an increase in surveillance, assimilation, classism, cisheterosexism, and social control into Black communities. We don\u2019t want to paint a picture of any of these figures as perfect, because we can only follow in the footsteps of the types of people that we know to have existed. As Davis asks of representations of Martin Luther King, Jr: \u201cHow could you possibly measure up to someone like that?\u201d145 She stresses that the Montgomery bus boycott \u2013 widely considered the birth of the civil rights movement \u2013 was started by ordinary people just like any one of us, and she emphasizes how important it is for us to know this in order to open possibilities for considering what role we might play in fundamental social transformation. Maggie L. Walker and the Independent Order of St Luke Maggie L. Walker\u2019s record of significantly intervening into the social world begins with her participation in what is believed to be the first anti-segregation school strike by Black students in the United States in 1883. She went on to become a teacher and part-time worker at an insurance company and later was hired as the secretary for the Independent Order of St Luke in Richmond, Virginia. The order had been founded in 1867 by former slave Mary Prout in Baltimore.146 Lily Hardy Hammond, writing in 1922, describes the Order of St Luke when Walker first came on board as \u201ca little benefit society in Richmond \u2013 one of probably a dozen or two,\u201d which had around 1,000 members. These societies were commonplace in Black communities where \u201csickness [was] a catastrophe such as only the poorest people can fully comprehend.\u201d The society paid its members out of dues if a member became sick or died, \u201cthus saving the family from what is often, among the very poor, a crushing burden of debt.\u201d147 At a time when nation-states were just beginning to offer workers\u2019 compensation themselves, local collective organizations, included this one started by Prout, acted as a social safety net. Working class people, including Black people and recent immigrants, would cumulatively contribute to a fund, and the collective would then support them from that fund if they needed it.148 The gradual development of private disability, workers\u2019 compensation, and life insurance are commonly described as contributing to the development of the modern welfare state and as a key part of social work history.149 Walker worked to expand services; by 1922, there were 100,000 members with the organization across twenty-one states. Walker also started the St Luke\u2019s Herald, which provided community and organizational news, and covered topics that preoccupied social work publications of the day such as \u201chealth, thrift, morals, and education.\u201d150 The Herald also provided detailed accounts of lynchings, segregation, and racism. The order adopted political positions, including supporting universal suffrage and anti-lynching efforts. It led the Richmond streetcar boycott against segregation in 1904.151 The Independent Order of St Luke created a bank in 1903 under Walker\u2019s direction. Walker thus became the first woman president of a bank in the United States. The bank provided financing for Black people to buy homes and go to college, among other things.152 These funds would have been otherwise difficult or impossible for Black people in the South to obtain. The predominantly circulated history of the credit union is that it was spread by Desjardins to the United States in 1908.153 Credit unions began in Germany, and had begun to be established in Qu\u00e9bec by Alphonse Desjardins in 1900 to help low-income people secure credit. Walker\u2019s bank seems to have been aligned with the ethos of early collectivist credit unions. When such work is undertaken by a disadvantaged racialized group to provide services for those who couldn\u2019t otherwise access them due to racial segregation and rampant poverty, it is a significant intervention into the social world, enabling people to better navigate and mitigate capitalism\u2019s violences. In 1909, Walker wrote that she wished to \u201cturn the course of that almighty stream of dollar, and see if we can till our own barren lands, feed our own hungry, and clothe our own naked.\u201d154 Yet, this bank is not considered part of credit union history. Like many other early women social workers of her time, Walker was also involved in club work. She founded a Richmond Council of Colored Women, which did community service and fundraising.155 When given the opportunity, Walker and other community members fundraised to establish a home for young women, with help from a white philanthropist. According to Walker, \u201cThe white philanthropist \u2026 said that if we colored women would show our interest in social work among our people by raising a thousand dollars for it, he would give us the use of a large house, and if we made good, he would deed it to a board of white and colored women for colored work.\u201d156 In response to this possibility, the community raised the money, and the women established the home. Walker said that white women in Richmond \u201chad done fine community work for white people,\u201d but that, with respect to this project, \u201cthe white women don\u2019t work for us, \u2013 they work with us.\u201d157 Walker worked with whomever was necessary, doing whatever was necessary, to help the Black community of Richmond and, indeed, the whole country. However, if you check the index of any social work text that is not specifically about Black social work, it is almost guaranteed that you won\u2019t find her name there. The Social Work Profession, Social Science, and Education Through the Progressive Era, many professions were not accessible to Black people in Canada and the United States because of the racist, segregationist educational and economic systems. Francille Wilson writes that the only two professions open to Black people were \u201cteaching and preaching,\u201d158 neither of which required a degree at the time. Social work had the potential to be yet another accessible profession for Black people,159 given that it was outside the systems of governing accredited bodies and academic programs (unlike law and medicine, by this time). Decent paid jobs were frequently obtainable for Black social workers in a number of social sectors, although often in segregated agencies or departments.160 The availability of social work jobs may, in part, explain why an increasing number of Black (and white) men entered the profession, which had previously been considered women\u2019s work.161 In fact, differentiating social work from charity often mapped onto differentiating the work that men were doing from that which women had been doing previously.162 An increasing emphasis on the use of social science was present in Black social work at the time. In the late nineteenth century, W.E.B. Du Bois started doing sociological studies of Black communities that served to identify their needs and combat racist notions about them.163 Some social science emphasized the desire to take social work out of the hands of the churches,164 but social science was taken up by social gospellers as well.165 As in white social work, a belief in the importance of systematic and scientific social work was commonly held by Black social workers across the political spectrum during this period.166 Black social workers also developed social work educational programs, with the first undergraduate program beginning in 1911.167 George Haynes, co-founder of the National Urban League (discussed earlier), established the program at Fisk University and advocated that an understanding of Black history was necessary for Black people to conduct effective Black social work.168 Haynes was motivated by the desire to ensure that Black service users were served by Black workers and that Black social workers did not become a professional underclass because they had fewer academic credentials.169 The first social work graduate program at a Black educational institution was established in 1922 at Atlanta\u2019s Morehouse College,170 and several other programs were created around the same time.171 Although social work programs had previously been available in white institutions, they did not teach from a Black perspective or address needs that were considered important in Black communities. Black Social Work in Canada Black social work in Canada has a number of similarities to the US history: churches played a major role in community work, reform efforts, and charity; there was a strong tradition of neighbour-to-neighbour helping and community improvement; and women took on important organizing roles, particularly with respect to schools and anti-slavery organizing.172 However, because Black communities were so much smaller in Canada than in the United States, and because of other factors such as political economy, geography, and climate, there were important differences too. The level of formal organization that occurred in the United States was simply not present in Canadian Black communities during the Progressive Era.173 Nonetheless, Black social work and social workers made important contributions to their communities and to the emerging profession of social work. Canada had a significant Black population for a number of reasons, including its own legacy of slavery, which began in 1628 when the first African slave was brought to what is now called Canada.174 The main sources of Black immigrants to Canada were slaves who accompanied British loyalists during the American Revolution, escaped slaves from Jamaica (known as the Maroons), freemen after the War of 1812, escaped American slaves through the Underground Railroad, and free US Black people trying to avoid American racism.175 Black communities in Canada during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were largely found in Ontario (called Upper Canada, Canada West, and the Province of Canada at various times) and Nova Scotia,176 although there were also notable populations on Vancouver Island177 and in Montr\u00e9al178 and several smaller cities.179 This settlement pattern was largely a product of the proximity of these English-speaking areas to the United States. Some Black settlers also migrated to the western provinces, but the government instituted anti-Black immigration policies before their numbers could rise significantly, as we discuss in chapter 4.180 Many US regions where Black people were legally \u201cfree\u201d had Black Laws or Black Codes, which seriously restricted the freedom and ability of many Black people to settle. This legal framework was yet another reason some Black people immigrated to Canada.181 In 1850, the US government passed the Fugitive Slave Act, allowing for the arrest of any escaped slave anywhere in the United States and requiring that person\u2019s return to their former \u201cowner.\u201d182 In the years following the passage of this act, around 50,000 former slaves* immigrated to Upper Canada.183 (To provide some perspective, the population of Toronto, called York at the time, was only 100,000 in 1841.184) Settlements in Canada A number of settlements were intentionally established as communities for escaped slaves and other Black people seeking a better life outside the pervasive and institutional racism of the United States. While this organizing has not been traditionally depicted as social work, those responsible for these initiatives were clearly engaged in making individuals\u2019 lives better,",

Edi\u00e7\u00e3o do Kindle. strengthening their communities, and undertaking many efforts that would later be called social work when white people did the same things for recent immigrants from Europe. It should be noted, though, that in spite of Canada\u2019s depiction as a refuge for Black people, many were surprised to find extreme racism in Canada as well.185 This hostility, as well as the difficulty of living off the land, meant that most people in the settlements had very difficult lives. A group of Black people who lived in Cincinnati organized to leave the city and travel to Canada in 1829. Cincinnati was a trading hub with the South, and white power brokers ensured that it was inhospitable to Black people.186 The city enforced the state\u2019s Black Laws, requiring, among other things, that new Black residents pay a $500 bond to ensure that they would be of good behaviour.187 In 1829, massive anti-Black race riots took place in Cincinnati. In an attempt to quell the violence and protect their families and property, about 300 Black men agreed to a government plan to voluntarily go to jail.188 This removal of adult men from the community did not quell the white attacks. However, according to Woodson, when the rioting ended, a number of the men who had surrendered themselves \u201cwere discharged on certificates of nativity, others gave bond for their support and good behavior, a few were dismissed as non-residents, a number of them were discharged by a justice of the Court of Common Pleas, and the rest were held indefinitely.\u201d189 Black men who had voluntarily agreed to be incarcerated in the hopes of staving off white violence were forced into forms of bail bonds, driven from the city, or indefinitely imprisoned. Prior to this incident, a group of local organizers had been planning to create a community in Ontario. The organizers likely chose an isolated rural area because they wanted to protect their community from white racism and aspired to achieve economic self-sufficiency.190 The numbers swelled after the riot; somewhere between 460 and 2,000 people fled to Canada. They settled in a community they called Wilberforce, near London, Ontario.191 Over the next decade, a school, stores, and farms were established. Wilberforce is depicted as a failure in the historical literature, but Nikki Taylor notes that the settlement met its original goal of independence.192 One of the reasons it was ultimately unsustainable was that the Canada Land Company, the Crown corporation that sold land to settlers, stopped selling land to Black settlers due to protests from white settlers in the region and the common white supremacist belief that Black people were not reliable enough to uphold their contracts.* In comparison to other settlements, Wilberforce was thus quite short lived. Yet, it provided an escape for many people fleeing racist violence and the Black Codes. Another settlement established near Windsor by the Refugee Home Society was founded in 1851,193 the year after the Fugitive Slave Act was passed and a mass exodus from the United States to Canada began in response. The Refugee Home Society offered a land-granting program with a systematic approach for providing assistance. Fugitive slaves were granted land (twenty-five acres, five acres of which were free). Settlers were then given nine years to pay for the remaining land, and the profits from the venture went into operating a school and continuing the organization\u2019s work, such as buying more land.194 One of the men credited with founding the Refugee Home Society is Henry Bibb. According to Fred Landon, Bibb believed that \u201cthe future of the people of color in Canada depended upon getting them settled on the land and his mind turned to the possibilities of establishing a distinctly Negro colony.\u201d195 For Bibb and the many Black people who lived in, organized, and supported Black colonies, this venture was a liberatory project. For the people who found refuge in Canada, it was also a liberatory project. Yet, while this designation is straightforwardly true, these Black people were also setting up colonies within a white settler colony. Celebrating Bibb in 1920, Landon titled his article \u201cHenry Bibb, a Colonizer.\u201d Bibb saw his chance for freedom for himself and his community as an active part of the colonial process. What was justice for his community helped sustain an injustice for another. Noticing how this one intensely oppressed group was complicit in the oppression of Indigenous people is, by no means, an attempt to undermine the horrors of slavery, including kidnapping, rape, enslavement, torture, and murder. Escaped slaves and other Black people were not wrong to flee to Canada. It was necessary for self-preservation, born of a context in which Black people had mostly come to the Americas through the brutality of the transatlantic slave trade. Bibb\u2019s colonizing can therefore be clearly distinguished from Europeans\u2019 choice to become part of the colonial project. However, it complicates things that former slaves adopted the role of settler. As Sunera Thobani describes, the colonial context of Canada (and the United States) results in any settlement and citizenship being complicit in the continued dispossession of Indigenous peoples\u2019 lands and sovereignty.196 Importantly, she notes this complicity alongside a careful study of the racism experienced by racialized immigrants in Canada, and she suggests that unless fundamental change is made at the level of what the nation is and its relationship to Indigenous communities and nations, the colonial complicity of all settlers remains an unresolvable dilemma. Mahmood says that agency lies not only in resisting social norms but also in how one inhabits norms. Whether in relation to Black women following the mores of separate spheres or escaped slaves taking up the work of colonization, clearly only so many options were available to long-denigrated peoples to enable them to survive and perform respectability. They may have reinforced oppressive mores and underlying moral economies of human value by doing what they did, but perhaps this contradiction might serve to invite us to reflect upon how each of us today uniquely inhabits oppressive mores, outside the simple framings of resistance versus complicity.197 Like many others, Bibb escaped slavery by becoming a colonizer. To complicate matters even further, the \u201cowner\u201d from whom he escaped was Indigenous.* Bibb wrote of his former slave master: \u201cHe was the most reasonable, and humane slaveholder that I have ever belonged to.\u201d He wrote that he would rather be owned by an Indigenous person than a white person.198 Yet, he was nevertheless this other man\u2019s legal property. Encouraging slave ownership was a US government tactic of assimilating Indigenous people in the South;199 it was a way Indigenous people were encouraged to inhabit \u201ccivilized\u201d mores. Certainly, some Indigenous people having owned slaves does nothing to cancel out or trump colonial injustices. Furthermore, Indigenous nations\u2019 responses to Black slavery were as diverse as the nations themselves. The Cherokee nation is said to have engaged in the most extensive Black slave ownership of all Indigenous groups: by the 1860s, the 17,000 members of the Cherokee nation owned 4,000 Black slaves.\u2020 The Seminole and Tuscarora nations, in contrast, provided safe haven for escaped slaves, resulting in many mixed relationships.200 Indigenous people had also been forced into slavery by Europeans and white settlers, starting with Columbus in 1492.201 Alan Gallay estimates that the British were involved in the slave trade of 30,000 to 50,000 Indigenous people in the United States by 1715.202 The practice of enslaving Indigenous people, however, was largely abandoned in the United States by 1720, in part because of militant resistance on the part of Indigenous nations.203 In telling Bibb\u2019s story, we hope to invite consideration of just how complex these histories are, rather than point fingers here or there. Bibb was a fugitive slave who, like so many slaves, was the son of a slave mother and a white father,204 and was likely conceived through the rape of his mother. He had been owned by a First Nations man on colonized land. Bibb escaped when his Indigenous master died, and went on to become a colonizer, purchasing land from the same British Crown that had stolen the land from Indigenous peoples across what\u2019s now called Canada and the United States. He did so to provide safe haven for other escaped slaves. Bibb was a social worker who contributed to founding an organization that helped his community secure basic freedom, education, and security. Bibb\u2019s story illustrates the intensity with which histories of slavery, colonialism, patriarchy, and social work interlock. When this social worker intervened in one political problem that was most pressing for him, he couldn\u2019t help but actively participate in another. Perhaps, in limitless variations, this complexity is the history of social work. Anti-Slavery Societies and Black Immigrant Assistance The earliest Black social work focused largely on assisting people who escaped slavery and fled to Canada, often with no money, no food, and no spare clothing. Rather than imagining this work to be exceptionally \u201cparticular\u201d to Black communities and therefore irrelevant to the subsequent development of social work more generally, we should look on it as work that helped to meet the needs of a group of people who were struggling as a result of unjust social conditions (as can be said of many social workings today and in the past). There was no state assistance for fugitive slaves (with the exception of Black people who emigrated after the War of 1812 and had assisted the British forces, who were given land).205 In response to this socially constituted need, a massive voluntary effort was undertaken to assist escaped slaves, which involved Black and white people collaborating in anti-slavery and liberation societies.206 These groups helped people find jobs, provided food and other resources, and more generally did the work that would later be called social work when undertaken in an organized way within poor white migrant communities. They also crossed national boundaries, just as later professional social work would do;207 for example, the American Anti-Slavery Society sent agents across the border to Canada to assist escaped slaves.208 These organizations fostered an ethos of mutual aid. Many of the people providing and organizing support were escaped slaves who had established themselves in Canada.209 Organizations like the Fugitives\u2019 Home and the Windsor Anti-Slavery Society were founded and run by fugitive slaves determined to assist other fugitives.210 Several were run by Black women, including the Ladies Freedman\u2019s Aid Society, the Ladies Colored Fugitive Association, and the Toronto Ladies\u2019 Association for the Relief of Destitute Colored Fugitives.211 Sharing the sensibility of what would soon be called social work, these organizations often believed that indiscriminate relief was bad and that aid should be restricted and controlled. For instance, the 1853 report of the Canada Anti-Slavery Society says: \u201cAll that able-bodied men and women require is a fair chance, friendly advice, and a little encouragement, perhaps a little assistance at first. Those who are really willing to work can procure employment in a short time after their arrival.\u201d212 While the fugitive relief effort was carried out on a massive scale, individual aid was often restricted, due to prevalent discourses of liberalism, capitalism, and scientific charity. It also bears repeating, yet again, that such relief efforts later run by white people for recent immigrants from Europe is called the origin of social work. Social Services A number of social work and social service projects were organized by members of Black communities in order to assist others in their communities. While some white people were also involved in helping escaped slaves, charitable and social services were segregated in Canada. Edward Lee and Ilyan Ferrer describe \u201csystemic exclusion from white social work institutions\u201d for the Black community.213 They also argue that \u201cthe exclusionary logic of the colour line was reflective of how communities of colour were racially segregated within the Canadian urban geography and provides further explanation as to why they were unable to access the white dominant charity or social settlement movements.\u201d The community building, aid, organizing, and advocacy that Black people did (and continue to do) are very clearly within the realm of what is considered social work, even though it has not been recognized as such in social work history: Elizabeth Jackson Shadd Shreve travelled through Southern Ontario forests to visit sick people and deliver food and clothing to those without;214 and Black people created youth groups, housing cooperatives, and political organizations like the Nova Scotia Association for the Advancement of Coloured People and the National Black Coalition in Nova Scotia.215 Benevolence clubs were also an important site of social service delivery and community building. One of the most prominent was called the True Band Society, which organized to create Black community self-sufficiency.216 The first True Band was founded in Amherstburg, Ontario (near Windsor), in 1854.217 Like the Provincial Union Association founded the same year, it worked to create and support Black community self-sufficiency.218 The True Bands provided resources to poor Black families, provided care for sick people, supported schools, and worked to resolve conflicts among community members.219 By 1856, there were\n\nChapman, Chris; Withers, A.J..

Edi\u00e7\u00e3o do Kindle. fourteen True Band organizations with 600 members.220 Both the Provincial Union and the True Bands formed out of critiques about the work of groups like the Refugee Home Society and people like Henry Bibb. They considered the raising of funds and supplies from white people to be shameful, and they wanted Black communities to be self-sufficient. They also opposed the construction of Black settlements, calling for people to integrate into Canadian society. One of the strongest voices against collecting resources (\u201cbegging,\u201d as they called it) was Mary Ann Shadd Cary, who was active in Black community social services and media.221 Black communities also built formal institutions modelled after those imported from Europe through colonialism.222 For example, Nova Scotian orphanages and children\u2019s homes wouldn\u2019t admit Black children \u2013 resulting in them sometimes being put in asylums or on work farms.223 Therefore, under the leadership of James R. Johnston and the African United Baptists Association, the Nova Scotia Home for Coloured Children (NSHCC) opened in 1921.224 Due to systemic racial segregation in social services,225 this institution was incredibly important to the Black community. Its opening marked the largest gathering of Black people in Nova Scotia since 1783.226 The NSHCC is an example of the social work initiatives that Black communities undertook in Canada. Candice Roker discusses the \u201cpositive survival\u201d resistance to racist exclusion of Black people in Nova Scotia. She argues that the creation of the NSHCC \u201cis one of the most public examples of the African Nova Scotian community taking care of its own.\u201d227 The NSHCC retained its historical name but became racially integrated in the 1970s;228 it continued to operate as an orphanage until the late 1980s.229 Like so many institutions that house vulnerable children, including Indian residential schools and many institutions for disabled children,230 significant abuses took place at the NSHCC. In 1948, a social worker documented concerns about inadequate food for the children living in the NSHCC. Sexual abuse was documented in the 1980s, including the rape of a child, but no charges were ever laid.231 In 2001, a number of former residents of the home filed lawsuits for abuse,232 some of which dates back to as early as the 1940s.233 In 2014, the premier of Nova Scotia apologized for the abuse as part of a settlement with survivors, and a restorative inquiry was announced in 2015.234 Terrible things happened at this institution that should never happen to anyone. It is entirely possible abuse was present there from its early days. Yet, even then, we can hold this injustice in tension with an acknowledgment of the importance of what the Nova Scotian Black community did by building the home. Building a racially segregated institution, which seems to have been characterized by the same abuses of power as were found at other institutional sites, can be conceptualized as yet another instance of navigating the norms that were available at the time. Black Nova Scotians built for their community\u2019s children a resource often considered at that time indispensable for serving children in need. As in so many other institutions, many children were seriously harmed within its walls. There is frequently a tendency to view historical developments as either good or bad, but removing the NSHCC from \u201cgood\u201d anti-racist history and placing it into \u201cbad\u201d institutional history prevents us from struggling to cultivate a complex relationship with this fundamentally interlocking history and its legacies. Black communities navigated available norms, but didn\u2019t adopt all available norms. As a glaring example with tremendous relevance to contemporary social work, we found no historical record of any Black community in the United States or Canada establishing a child protection agency in which people from outside a family or community scrutinized parents and determined whether a child would be allowed to remain with them. In the extensive social welfare systems created by Black folks in Canada and the United States, we found no evidence of a single Black agency that practised involuntary child apprehension. White child protection agencies didn\u2019t normally* serve Black families until the end of legal racial segregation in the mid-twentieth century. Yet, even in cities with significant Black social welfare infrastructures, including women\u2019s clubs, settlement houses, and orphanages, it seems that no Black community practised child apprehension. (If we\u2019re wrong and one or two communities did so, it would have been extremely marginal considering that we\u2019ve encountered no trace of it.) Black and white social workers learned from one another and often worked together, developing similar (usually racially segregated) services, but Black social workers didn\u2019t practice child apprehension. In the only article we found exploring the fact that professional child welfare didn\u2019t operate in US Black communities until after legal racial segregation was abolished,\u2020 Jillian Jimenez writes: \u201cA shadow child welfare system [existed] that performed similar functions to the public child welfare system from which African American children were largely excluded.\u201d235 In apparently every Black community, people were left to do the work of \u201cchild protection\u201d and \u201cchild welfare\u201d using means that had been available to them before anybody had ever become a paid \u201csocial worker.\u201d In a recent interview about having won the Woman of Distinction Award, Black Canadian politician Zanana Akande was asked where her ethic of \u201ccontinuing to push\u201d for justice originated. In her answer, she described the informal \u201csocial workers who weren\u2019t social workers\u201d who collectively raised her when she was growing up in downtown Toronto in the 1940s and \u201950s: \u201cThat [ethic] comes from where I was born and the people around me \u2013 the first social workers who weren\u2019t social workers, because we were all raised collectively by our parents and by anyone else who happened to walk down the street and see us \u2013 that you must speak out, you must take care of each other, and you must push for what you want.\u201d236 In Black communities prior to the end of racial segregation and the introduction of child protective agencies into Black communities, practices, norms, and mores were in place to protect children from violence, respond to tragedies such as parental death, and so on. \u201cChildren routinely lived with grandparents not only in the case of death, but when one or both parents left the local area to look for work \u2026 [and] children with no family would be taken in by unrelated adults in the neighbourhood who did not have children.\u201d237 Resonant practices have existed in all communities at all times, varying significantly from place to place. Jimenez traces these specific Black child welfare practices to West African traditions of extended kinship and communal care for children, as well as to strategies later developed in response to the violences of slavery \u2013 in which Black children and adults were kidnapped, forcibly separated from one another, and held as white people\u2019s property. In the first half of the twentieth century in Black communities in the United States, the principal strategy for protecting children from abuse and neglect was community surveillance: \u201cthe extended family, especially grandmothers \u2026 aunts, great aunts, and older sisters \u2026 provided a concentric circle of approval and disapproval to support or criticize the child rearing practices of a child\u2019s primary caretakers.\u201d238 There were community-sanctioned interventions for when adults harmed children, which were rooted in community-specific hierarchies of moral and political authority. Older women relatives in Black America occupied the role only then being taken over in white America by paid ruling class strangers. One practice is a violent imposition, and the other assumes communities are capable of healing and protecting themselves; both are specific and situated means of social working to keep children safe from abuse and neglect. A very different child protection system would be in place today if families and communities were imagined capable of protecting and caring for their own children, rather than assuming the state and its professionals must do so. As a consequence of racist laws and mores, Black families were fortunate to rarely have their children apprehended by state authorities during the first half of the twentieth century. Instead, they carried on and internally adapted long-standing traditions of child protection and care. The earliest white child protection agencies were born at a time of normalized extreme anti-Black violence. Black childrearing practices at the time therefore explicitly sought to prevent children from exposing themselves to the normative violences of white supremacy;239 we can imagine the devastation that might have resulted had Black families become targeted by white social work. Black families worked to protect Black children from abusive parents and also from white supremacy. Their efforts were central to Black child protection during a time of widespread lynching and other explicit anti-Black violence. Such child protection isn\u2019t normatively validated as \u201csocial work.\u201d Of all the diverse and significant Black interventions into the social world for over a century, from slavery liberation societies through to the civil rights movement of the mid-twentieth century, there seems to have been a consensus that the approach to \u201cchild protection\u201d taken for granted among white ruling classes wasn\u2019t morally or politically acceptable. No matter how one is positioned in relation to these histories, this wholesale rejection is an astounding fact for us all to seriously reflect upon today. Class Stratification and How It Interlocked with Racism and Social Work As with white social workers, Black social workers in the United States and Canada tended to be upper or middle class people assisting poor people. Class divisions among Black people, however, had different effects and significance from those among white people, given that segregation and racism had a levelling effect on Black communities. No matter how much money you had, you often could not live in a ruling class neighbourhood if you were Black, nor was it easy to get a loan, be free from the threat of racist violence, go many places, or do many other things available to white people. Class status did not inoculate against racism. Carlton-LaNey writes, \u201cThere was very little physical, social and economic distance\u201d between those doing early Black social work and others in the communities where they worked. They \u201clived in the same communities and by virtue of race shared many of the same societal problems and issues of concern.\u201d However, those \u201cwho engaged in the emerging social work profession were among the \u2026 educated elite of the African American community.\u201d240 Educated Black women primarily provided social services,241 which could have perpetuated white ruling class social mores. Yet, Carlton-LaNey asserts that \u201clower class women were also active in clubs and formed organizations in an effort to serve themselves and the needy in their communities.\u201d242 She writes that this class diversity among workers, as well as shared experiences of racism, helped these social workers more reflexively consider their own power: even educated Black social workers with \u201cproperty ownership, poise, and eloquence \u2026 [were often] treated like \u2018washerwomen\u2019 [which] \u2026 kept them attuned to the deplorable conditions to which their less-fortunate sisters were subjected.\u201d243 Through to the 1920s, \u201ca white woman in Halifax looking for help with her laundry felt free to stop any African-Nova Scotian woman on the street and request \u2018where she could get a good girl.\u2019\u201d244 White supremacy served to homogenize Blackness so that, in practice, it was the only relevant identifier in many cases, or at least it was the identity category that trumped all others. The assumption that any Black person would know where to get a cleaner in Halifax was based on the pervasive white supremacist association of Black people with domestic service and dirt. This thinking had important social significance and was intimately tied up with interlocking moral economies of human value. At this time, eugenics was often referred to as \u201cmental hygiene,\u201d245 and Ivory Soap boasted about its ability to \u201ccivilize\u201d Indigenous people.246 This period was also the era in which white ruling class women acquired an unprecedented degree of exalted bourgeois subjectivity. Fellows and Razack explain that dirt was important in constituting these select women as separate and distinct from \u2013 and to imagine themselves morally superior to \u2013 \u201cwasherwomen.\u201d247 The renegotiation of white ruling class women\u2019s positioning within largely unchanged moral economies of human value relied on the intensive and ongoing discursive denigration of others. Remaining racially devalued even with upward class mobility, Black social workers\u2019 experiences of continued discrimination, alongside the relative class diversity among Black service providers, seems to have mitigated the classism normally inherent to social work. Most Black women welfare reformers, according to Gordon, \u201cwere usually newly middle-class, perhaps a generation away from slavery and without much cushion against economic misfortune.\u201d248 These women were living a very different experience of being middle class than that of their white contemporaries.\n\nChapman, Chris; Withers, A.J..

Edi\u00e7\u00e3o do Kindle. contemporaries.249 Knupfer, in describing the Phyllis Wheatley Club in Chicago, therefore makes the case that \u201cbecause club women were well aware of the double burden of racism and sexism which all African-American women faced, more often than not they reached \u2018across\u2019 rather than \u2018down\u2019 to their less fortunate sisters.\u201d250 The club\u2019s social work was \u201cmutual and reciprocal\u201d between poor and middle class members.251 In addition to sharing experiences of anti-Black oppression, Carlton-LaNey notes that shared Black pride also \u201cserved as a mechanism for group solidarity and helped to undercut class differences.\u201d252 It seems that race mitigated the class oppression that early Black social workers exercised, as compared to white social work at the time. However, other scholars cite historical evidence of overt and insidious classism among Black social workers too. Many of the class biases that existed in the work of friendly visitors and other white charity work were also present among Black social work organizations. For example, urban Northern social workers who provided social services to migrants from the South often looked down upon the people they were trying to help. Martin and Martin say that Black social workers, like other urban Northern Americans, perceived the migrants as \u201cuncouth, unkempt, boisterous, and ignorant.\u201d253 Northern urban social workers, Black and white, therefore engaged in what Sheila Weiss calls an \u201ceffort of the middle class to mold the behavior of the migrants in its own image [which] was clearly a one-way process. There was never any hint that the black bourgeoisie had anything to learn from its newly arrived neighbors.\u201d254 Like many other well-meaning people working to affect social change, then and now, early Black social workers often seem to have believed they knew what was best for the people they worked with. But their ideas were often informed by classist moral economies. This classed outlook was evident, for example, when Black professor R.L. Smith of Oakwood, Texas, began community organizing to make his community more aesthetically pleasing in 1889.255 As a ruling class man, he understood the physical appearance of the village to be its most pressing need. It was only after a year, when only minor issues had been resolved and people didn\u2019t follow through on more major and expensive undertakings, that he began to wonder why the response had been so lukewarm. He realized it was because the people he was working with were poor. He concluded that \u201cwhat the Negro farmers of Texas and of the South really needed was not, at this stage, a Village Improvement Society.\u201d256 If Smith had facilitated a conversation about what the community needed and how it should go about achieving those needs at the initial meeting a year earlier, their efforts may have been much more productive. Having largely done nothing for the first year, Smith now set out to reduce poverty, alongside his own aim of getting people to improve their homes and yards. He helped organize a cooperative in which farmers in the area pooled their resources, enabling two important changes: buying in bulk (obtaining discounts for volume purchases) and avoiding the use of credit, which could mean substantial savings in interest payments. After the organization had been somewhat successful in helping farmers gain financial security, an organization called the Negro Cooperative Society was founded. Smith was a supporter of the Booker T. Washington \u2013 or liberal, rather than radical \u2013 school of Black activism, and he tied the ranks in the organization to how much people had saved. Only once someone achieved the twelfth degree, and was thus named \u201cGrand Patriarch,\u201d did they gain a vote at conference.257 The richest members of the cooperative society were granted exclusive voting rights, enabling them to direct the society regardless of support from its majority. Class hierarchy and bias drove this organizational design in a clear illustration of the material effects of moral economy: those already regarded superior tend to accumulate further moral (and thus political) capital. It\u2019s assumed that those who have saved the most money are most deserving and will know best. From there, a structure is built that allows those with the most political and moral capital to gain even more institutional political power \u2013 even in this \u201ccooperative.\u201d Indeed, a large cross-section of Black social workers supported Booker T. Washington\u2019s principles, which \u201cmeasure success by the ownership of land, homes, businesses, union membership, and bank accounts.\u201d258 The class status of most Black social workers, like most social workers in general, informed their values and understandings of the world. According to Peebles-Wilkins and Francis, \u201cThese women\u2019s ideals were [ruling class] American ideals.\u201d259 They accepted the dominant views of society, working to reform some systems of oppression while leaving others intact \u2013 especially capitalism. Peebles-Wilkins and Francis suggest that Black upwardly mobile social workers, such as Mary Church Terrell, \u201cespoused fundamental, traditional American values about family, the work ethic, social obligations, democracy, and freedom that she transmitted cross-culturally.\u201d They write: \u201cThe goals of black women activists focused on uplift and contained the overtones of social Darwinism,\u201d which was the assumed social good of unimpeded competition within existing social and political structures.260 Many Black social workers, like white ones, upheld capitalism, which, after all, was the economic system permitting their upward mobility. They worked towards cumulative individual racial uplift within the parameters of existing economic and moral systems, rather than working to overhaul the system for the benefit of those suffering the most from it. Many social workers, informed by liberal individualism and prevalent moral economies of race and class differentiation, directed their change efforts at individuals rather than the social structures that caused such differentiation. Cornelius Bynum reports that \u201cAfrican American elites largely accommodated white racist assumptions about black inferiority.\u201d261 Martin and Martin suggest that established residents of the urban North \u201cfeared that the newcomers would reinforce stereotypes of black people and stir up antiblack sentiments that would have dire consequences for all black people.\u201d262 While social workers worked to \u201chelp\u201d poor people, they also often worked to normalize and assimilate members of the Black community so that \u2013 like white ruling class women \u2013 they too might gain what Fellows and Razack call a toehold on respectability.263 When social workers did explicitly set out to address systemic issues, they became burnt out, claim Martin and Martin. As a result, in the end, \u201cthey focused their attention on trying to change the character of the victims of the dominant system, helping them to cope better with their oppression.\u201d264 Social work interventions were frequently about normalizing poor Black people and getting them to conform to middle class behaviours, aesthetics, and values.265 This form of social work involved many of the same interventions that the friendly visitors stressed: cleanliness, good housekeeping, temperance, thrift, and so on. The 1921 report of Cincinnati\u2019s Negro Civic Welfare Committee of the Council of Social Agencies demonstrates that the committee was incredibly condescending and paternalistic towards working class people and enacted capitalist indoctrination. The committee operated a workplace friendly visiting program involving over 800 Black women. \u201cShe goes and gives friendly advice on punctuality, regularity, efficiency, thrift, and tries to develop in them the proper attitude toward their work.\u201d266 This committee may well have advocated for workers, and the citation above may have been written to attract donations. Yet, the report depicts this social work organization as working to improve people\u2019s lives by helping them transform into more productive capitalist subjects, something that did nothing to improve the institutionalized social, economic, political, and moral barriers they experienced. We\u2019re not saying that any of the work of early Black social workers shouldn\u2019t have been done. Rather, we can all uniquely interrogate the complexities of the past in order to better understand and interrupt patterns we may continue to replicate, uniquely positioned as each one of us is within these legacies. As bell hooks says, \u201cInterlocking systems [of oppression] indict us all in some way.\u201d267 Early Women Social Workers and Gender Roles Working to ameliorate some of the harshness caused by capitalism while upholding the system itself is similar to how many early women social workers \u2013 Black and white \u2013 approached gender. Separate spheres discourse was incredibly oppressive for women. Yet, its specific contours and divisions also created possibilities for women to take up leadership roles in what came to be called social work. Women encroached into public spaces by intervening into others\u2019 private spheres. As is true of all communities, Black women responded to gendered expectations in diverse ways. Mary Church Terrell, the honorary lifetime president of the National Association of Colored Women (NACW), largely supported separate spheres.268 However, Maggie Walker was adamantly and publicly opposed to separate spheres. Writing in 1912, she argued: \u201cThere is neither justice or good common sense in the demand that every woman should confine her activities to the domestic duties of home . . . As ability, adaptability decide these things for men, so let them decide for woman.\u201d269 Walker, the first woman bank president in the United States, supported equal rights for women, which included for her the abolition of the mores of gendered separate spheres. Furthermore, regardless of their own navigation of separate spheres, many early Black social workers advocated for suffrage and gender equality,* including Mary Ann Shadd Cary,270 Mary Church Terrell, Ida B. Wells-Barnett,271 and Maggie Walker.272 Women exposed themselves to the risks of men\u2019s patriarchal moralizing when they became active in the public sphere. For example, Henry Bibb said of Mary Ann Shadd Cary\u2019s disagreement with him about how the community should fund a school that her outspokenness \u201cwill add nothing to her credit as a lady.\u201d273 Yee explains: \u201c[W]hile Black women\u2019s participation in community-building may have been considered an acceptable extension of women\u2019s domestic responsibility beyond the private household, those who did so found themselves in a delicate balancing act.\u201d274 If Black women social workers were too outspoken, their femininity and precarious toehold on respectability could be questioned \u2013 within a patriarchal understanding in which femininity and outspokenness were antithetical. Subjugated Community-Based Social Workings Beyond Black and White The relatively large number of Black people in what\u2019s now called Canada and the United States up to the periods we\u2019re discussing is a direct result of the transatlantic slave trade. The relatively small number of migrants from Asia and other parts of the world \u2013 through to the 1960s \u2013 is a direct result of exclusionary racist immigration policies. Due to these two white supremacist practices, there were many more Black people in what\u2019s now called the United States and Canada than any other racialized groups from the Global South. However, some people from Asia and other parts of the world did migrate here. As in Black and white communities, these communities also came together in new ways to meet needs that resulted from the massive demographic shifts occurring. Most of these communities\u2019 efforts have not been as extensively documented as those in white and Black communities, making tracing their histories difficult; but this scarce documentation doesn\u2019t mean they weren\u2019t actively involved in the diverse activities of social working. Some research exists on the Chinese community in British Columbia (BC). During the era when professional social work was born, Chinese folks in BC \u201corganiz[ed] a remarkable number of voluntary mutual aid fraternal associations, partly in response to the racial discrimination they suffered,\u201d beginning soon after they first arrived in Canada in the late 1850s.275 These groups organized to fight racism, provide social services within their own community, and facilitate conflict resolution. Mutual aid groups operated in Chinese communities in BC for about a century, and were integral to the community in the face of the tremendous racist hostilities that surrounded them.276 Around the same time, the Sikh community in BC worked collectively with other South Asians to provide food, housing, and jobs for those in need; lobby the government; and fight discrimination. Today, we would call this collection of activities \u201cnewcomer settlement social work,\u201d and it\u2019s basically exactly what white and Black social workers were providing and calling social work at the time. In 1907, the Vancouver Khalsa Diwan Society was established as a Sikh religious organizing body, but, according to Norman Buchignani, Doreen Indra, and Ram Srivastava, it \u201cquickly involved itself in matters of general [South Asian] community welfare and became the focal point for subsequent South Asian battles against discrimination.\u201d277 While the initial group was Sikh, it is said to have \u201cspoke[n] for all South Asian",

A narrow focus on friendly  visiting, scientific charity, and casework helps construct one of the two found ing movements of social work as problematic but not really central to systemic  violences against long-targeted populations and their moral denigration in  popular, professional, and scholarly discourse. Discussions of the ugly laws and  The Tribe of Ishmael feature prominently in discourse about eugenics, especially  in disability scholarship, but the leadership role that the emergent social work  profession played in these and other eugenic practices is largely left out of many  histories of social work. Furthermore, as we explore in more detail further on,  we will see it was not only the COS wing of early social work that led the eugen \nics movement. In this regard, the COS worked in tandem with the progressive  and radical activists associated with settlement houses, all in apparent agree ment that poor and disabled people who don\u2019t live according to ruling class  social mores are best incarcerated in gender-segregated sites in order to prevent  \nfurther generations of those whom they all agreed were \u201cdefective.\u201d The history of eugenics forces a re-evaluation of the commonly accepted  political spectrum ranging from right-wing reactionaries to left-wing radicals.  Liberals and radicals alike, whether Marxist, feminist, anarchist, or other, tended  to work for eugenic aims a century ago.82 Organized opposition to eugenics  came almost entirely from the Catholic Church, and was animated by uphold ing conservative values in a way that many Catholics would say are entirely  consistent with conservative Catholic values and contemporary Catholic activ ism against euthanasia and abortion.83 In a truly conservative world view, each  person has their proper place,* and it is not appropriate to interfere in this natu ral, divine, or traditional order. Poor and disabled people should therefore not  be eradicated; their lives should be defended like any other. But the social and  political landscape should not be shifted in their favour; it should be conserved  as is. Nineteenth and early twentieth century liberals and radicals, in contrast,  believed in social progress. They believed in making the world a better place  Copyright \u00a9 2019.

In broad strokes, liberals like Richmond  believed political change should happen through cumulative individual hard  work with as little outside interference in personal choice and liberty as pos sible (including the \u201cinterference\u201d of charity), while radicals tended to believe  in collective efforts towards more fundamental changes directly targeting the",

Thomas McCarthy points out: \u201cWith mutual interest in settlement work  as the start, Addams and Davis would develop a professional relationship of  mutual respect and social reform support.\u201d146 One journalist even said: \u201cIf Jane  Addams were President [of the United States], Katharine Davis would be her  Vice President.\u201d147 \nOf this would-be VP to Addams, Nicole Rafter notes: \u201cNo Progres sive penologist had greater impact on eugenic criminology than Katherine  Bement Davis.\u201d148 Davis was the superintendent of the Bedford Hills Refor matory for women, the first penal institution in the world that could hold  someone for life, their sentence based on what was believed to be permanent  degeneracy rather than on specific crimes they committed. Addams wrote an  endorsement for Bedford Hills to be built so that Davis could implement this  eugenic plan.149 \nTo prevent \u201cunfit\u201d persons from marrying, Addams called on governments  \u201cto insist upon health certificates from the applicant for a marriage license, that  the health of future children might in a certain measure, be guaranteed,\u201d150 and  she was involved in plans to institutionalize women who had been labelled as  feebleminded in order to keep them from having children.151 \nLike the COS, which published The Tribe of Ishmael, the Hull-House\u2013 associated Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy also created eugenic  propaganda.

For example, the Eugenics Record Office (ERO) was a data gath ering and surveillance body that worked to catalogue the \u201cunfit\u201d and pro mote eugenics. Two of its first field workers had been settlement workers,  and twenty-two ERO fieldworkers later became social workers.154 In many  ways, Addams and the settlement movement were radical and on the side  of social justice, but in other ways they weren\u2019t. We don\u2019t intend here to dis miss Addams\u2019s significance, but rather to adjust what should be taken from  it. We can learn from her remarkable determination and struggle, and we can  also learn from her racism, classism, and disablism \u2013 like our own \u2013 without  excusing it. \nChapman, C., & Withers, A.

It\u2019s therefore easy to read this phrase many  times without knowing where it was originally spoken. \nThe first public reading and publication of Pratt\u2019s paper was at the 1892  National Conference on Charities and Corrections,180 which later became the  National Conference of Social Work. To give some context, other featured  themes included immigration, the insane, the feebleminded, and women in  philanthropy. Of these themes, apart from \u201ccharity organization,\u201d no other  theme had more than three papers devoted to it \u2013 although there was a special  tribute to influential eugenicist Oscar McCulloch, the COS leader discussed  earlier who wrote The Tribe of Ishmael181 and had recently died; four people paid  tribute to him. \u201cIndian policy\u201d had six papers devoted to it \u2013 twice as many as  any other theme apart from McCulloch\u2019s tributes and charity organization.182 Several of these Indian policy papers focused on the education of Indigenous  children. \nTo give a different kind of context, the National Conference on Charities  and Corrections directly became legitimized professional social work and is  consistently acknowledged as having done so in social work histories, however  selectively. Their 1892 program gives us a glimpse of what leaders of what was  soon called professional social work were up to at the time; yet, 1892 was also  the year that Black anti-lynching activist and social worker Ida B. Wells (dis \ncussed in chapter 2) published Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases,183 which is a very different kind of social working than that of McCulloch or Pratt.  We can just pause to consider what gets included or excluded in normative  social work history. \nWhile Pratt was not a social worker, it should be recalled that nobody had  ever called themselves or anyone else a social worker in 1892. The term didn\u2019t  exist. However, the organization through which \u201csocial work\u201d came into being  over the next decade considered Pratt one of their own.

For example, when we write that Martin Luther King Jr  delivered the \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech in 1963,219 we anticipate that many read \ners will know of this speech and its enduring significance. That shared knowl edge will help to ground readers\u2019 understanding of what we say from there.  The very next year several significant things happened in relation to anti-Black  racism and anti-racist struggle: King won the Nobel Peace Prize220 (showing  how well established his activism was by this time); Malcolm X completed the  Hajj to Mecca, delivered his speech \u201cThe Ballot or the Bullet,\u201d and began to  distance himself from the Nation of Islam (NOI)221 (signifying that he\u2019d already  done the majority of the significant interventions into the social world he\u2019s most  widely remembered for as a member of the NOI); and the US Congress passed  the Civil Rights Act, which banned discrimination based on race.222 All these  Copyright \u00a9 2019. University of Toronto Press. All rights reserved.\nthings happened in 1964. But the year 1964 was also the year that the Africville  relocation began.223 It didn\u2019t begin previous to civil rights struggle. By the time the last Africville resident had been removed from his home,  both King and Malcolm X had been assassinated.224 Therefore, every word  either one spoke that has ever been represented in a film, a song, a T-shirt, or  an email signature had already been spoken by the time Africville was finally  emptied of its residents and bulldozed. The demolition was not a relic of the  overtly racist pre\u2013civil rights era. \nThe Africville relocation was justified beforehand and considered a suc cess afterward as a movement away from racial segregation and towards  integration \u2013 by white liberals, not by Africville residents.225 Liberal whites",

First, they are sometimes represented as the right-wing extreme  of problematic, classist, and control-oriented social work, which is far from  how they viewed themselves. This self-perception is important if we consider  contemporary social work and how practitioners view themselves today: while  some front-line workers imagine themselves radical, we\u2019ve personally never met  social work professionals who claim to be any further to the right of the political  spectrum than liberal. The majority of social workers appear to feel that they\u2019re  aligned with left of centre political critique. Yet, surely this self-perception does  something to hamper critiques of social work \u2013 whether from scholars, clients,  or community groups. Our concern is that claims of relative innocence enable  Copyright \u00a9 2019. University of Toronto Press.

If no actual social workers imagine them selves as part of this complicit conservative community, nobody will change  their practices in light of the already widely circulating critiques. But if both  liberal and radical social workers have been implicated in interlocking oppres sions ever since the emergence of professional social work, the implications for  contemporary ethics and politics are very different. \nImplicit in and alongside the polarized framing of the settlement movement  versus the COS is a framing in which all casework and immediate meeting of  needs are imagined to be conservative and all community-level interventions  \nChapman, C., & Withers, A.

The first US COS chapter was  founded in 1877 in Buffalo, New York.29 Sometimes called COSs, sometimes  called Associated Charities, chapters sprung up across North America, with  the first in Canada established in 1881.30 Within eleven years, the number of  friendly visitors in the United States tripled.31 In 1911, the (US) National Asso \nciation of Societies for Organizing Charity (NASOC) was founded, and within  three years it had 143 member organizations.32 By 1912, Canada had at least  four COSs: Toronto, Montr\u00e9al, Winnipeg, and London.33 \nIn social work history, COSs are most famous for \u201cfriendly visiting,\u201d in which  ruling class volunteers would visit, typically, between two and four poor fami lies on a regular basis. According to Mary Richmond, when people see those in  need, they generally mistakenly \u201cinterfere by sending help,\u201d which \u201coften does  more harm than good, and becomes a temptation rather than a help.\u201d As an  alternative, she advocated for what she called a scientific approach, involving  friendly visitors (and later professional caseworkers) \u201cwho would seek out and,  with patience and sympathy, strive to remove the causes of need.\u201d In doing so,  friendly visitors might offer advice on alcohol consumption or spending, but  they worked towards no changes to the capitalist system that allows a certain  percentage of the population to live without enough food, sufficient shelter, and  other necessities. Yet, Richmond described friendly visiting as a means by which  \u201csocial conditions could be wonderfully improved.\u201d34 This claim is an astound \ning example of what Leslie Margolin critiques as \u201cthe healing power of class.\u201d35 It\u2019s troubling that Richmond would claim that this approach would improve  \u201csocial conditions,\u201d and this legacy of imagining political change through indi vidual interventions based upon the ruling classes\u2019 imagined moral superiority  Copyright \u00a9 2019.

That the political solution to poverty could be cumulative visits  from ruling class people who offer advice, and who ensure that poor people  receive only the most necessary and minimal material relief, if any at all, clearly  depoliticizes poverty and inequality. \nAlthough she grew up a poor orphan, much of Richmond\u2019s work denigrates  poor people as morally reprehensible. Richmond recognized the significance  of social context, but what\u2019s perhaps most relevant to contemporary framings  of political issues is how she did so a century ago. She writes: \u201cThe personal  and social causes of poverty act and react upon each other, changing places as  cause and effect, until they form a tangle that no hasty, impatient jerking can  unravel.\u201d36 This statement seems pretty balanced, in theory.

McCulloch  was the founder and leader of the Indianapolis chapter of the COS, and a leader  of the National Conference Standing Committee on Organization of Charities  in Cities.59 In The Tribe of Ishmael, this COS leader compared a poor family to \u201ca  crustacean which has left the free, independent life common to its family, and is  living as a parasite, or pauper.\u201d60 He described the family as a \u201cpauper ganglion  of several hundreds,\u201d61 argued that they were hereditarily unfit, and said that  indiscriminate aid had facilitated both their immorality and their reproduction.  This COS-published text was one of the earliest to instill fear in the general pub \nlic about both indiscriminate relief and the eugenic threat that poor, disabled,  and racialized people posed.

Second, we must check private and  indiscriminate benevolence \u2026 Third, we must get hold of the children.\u201d64 \nThe same decade that McCulloch presented his study to fellow charity work ers in 1888, Galton coined the term \u201ceugenics,\u201d and Nova Scotia began imple menting child welfare policy.65 The emergence of societies for the prevention  Copyright \u00a9 2019.

McCulloch  was the founder and leader of the Indianapolis chapter of the COS, and a leader  of the National Conference Standing Committee on Organization of Charities  in Cities.59 In The Tribe of Ishmael, this COS leader compared a poor family to \u201ca  crustacean which has left the free, independent life common to its family, and is  living as a parasite, or pauper.\u201d60 He described the family as a \u201cpauper ganglion  of several hundreds,\u201d61 argued that they were hereditarily unfit, and said that  indiscriminate aid had facilitated both their immorality and their reproduction.  This COS-published text was one of the earliest to instill fear in the general pub \nlic about both indiscriminate relief and the eugenic threat that poor, disabled,  and racialized people posed.

Organized social work across the United States and Canada saw this  event as an opportunity to prove the importance of the new profession, and  social workers from the biggest cities in both countries came to Halifax to pro vide and organize relief. Half a century after these earlier social workers had  withheld relief from Africville residents following the explosion, social workers  centrally participated in the destruction of the community and the relocation  of its roughly 400 residents.216 \nMany Canadians learn about Africville, a small, tightly knit and independent  community on the Halifax Harbour that was well established prior to World  War I.

In its liberal version, settlement  houses with their radical community organizing and social transformation  work are nicely complemented by the more individually oriented casework,  creating a harmonious and diverse foundation for all subsequent social work.3 In its radical iteration, the settlement houses and Addams are held in sharp  contrast to the COS and framed as what social work should strive to be.4 What  the liberal and radical versions share is a common understanding that these two  distinct spheres of interventions into the social world mark out the parameters  of what social work was and can ever be. \nWhile it\u2019s undoubtedly true that there\u2019s much to learn from Addams and the  settlement movement, we discuss why it\u2019s a mistake to hold these interventions  only as positive examples and/or as entirely positive examples.

She cri tiqued the moralistic underpinning of the COS and suggested that poor com munities are characterized by a higher ethical standard by which neighbours  assist one another. She wrote, \u201cA most striking incongruity, at once apparent, is  the difference between the emotional kindness with which relief is given by one  poor neighbor to another poor neighbor and the guarded care with which relief  is given by a charity visitor to a charity recipient,\u201d which she describes as \u201can  absolute clashing of two ethical standards.\u201d94 For Addams, COS interventions  into the social and ethical realm of a poor community were damaging. Addams  advocated that practices and moralities in poor communities should not be  displaced. Within poor communities, she said, \u201cthe fact that the economic  condition of all alike is on a most precarious level makes the ready outflow of  sympathy and material assistance the most natural thing in the world.\u201d This  communal precarity results in what she exalted as \u201cself-sacrifice quite unknown  in the circles where greater economic advantages make that kind of intimate  knowledge of one\u2019s neighbors impossible.\u201d95 \nThe neighbourly assistance Addams celebrated and admired was given without  means tests, background checks to ensure that nobody else was helping the person  or family, lectures about how to live a more moral or thrifty life, or otherwise blam ing and shaming people for their poverty. If someone expressed a need to another  person who could meet it, the other person would respond with the needed assis tance, she said. For Addams, then, the world would do much better with more  people acculturated to poor communities\u2019 ethical standards rather than to ruling  class ones.

As a result, Addams said, she \u201cdiscovers how incor rigibly bourgeois her standards have been, and it takes but a little time to reach  the conclusion that she cannot insist so strenuously upon the conventions of  her own class.\u201d97 Interestingly, Addams articulated these various critiques of the  COS and its work within her conceptualization of a radical view of democracy.  For Addams, democracy goes well beyond \u201ca sentiment which desires the well being of all\u201d or a \u201cbelie[f] in the essential dignity and equality of all.\u201d98 Democ racy, she said, also demands \u201ca rule of living\u201d from each of us, by which \u201call must  turn out for one another, and at least see the size of one another\u2019s burdens.\u201d99 What she called democratic or \u201csocial ethics\u201d relies upon being exposed to the  real-life experiences of one another. She claimed that the \u201cdemocratic spirit \u2026  implies that diversified human experience and resultant sympathy \u2026 are the  foundation and guarantee of Democracy.\u201d100 Addams promoted a democracy  that recognizes inequality, difference, and diversity.

Here we focus primarily on \u201cthe color-line,\u201d a phrase made famous by Black activist-scholar W.E.B Du Bois at the same time as the term \u201csocial work\u201d was coined.1 We focus on the work the colour line continues to do since his time in its framing of the Progressive Era. We reflect upon who gets credited for making history and how this choice maps onto moral economies that separate who is and isn\u2019t a valued human with something to offer our social world. In contrast to the histories most circulated, at the time the term \u201csocial work\u201d was coined, community initiatives and innovations in working with disadvantaged groups as well as efforts to transform political structures were taking place all over the world. Many of the people involved in these diverse interventions into the social world were neither Christian nor secular, and many weren\u2019t white. For example, according to Saba Mahmood, Zaynab al-Ghazali \u201cis credited with establishing a women\u2019s organization [in Egypt] called the Society of Muslim Ladies \u2026 which was initially dedicated to providing charitable services to poor women and children\u201d and later expanded to work towards structural change in collaboration with the Muslim Brotherhood.2 The Society of Muslim Ladies was established in the 1930s, and it might be imagined that al-Ghazali\u2019s efforts were made possible due to feminist successes in Europe and white settler colonies like Canada and the United States. However, Mahmood shows that al-Ghazali\u2019s interventions into the social world were \u201ca product of the sociopolitical ethos of her times and the new possibilities that were opening up for women at the turn of the twentieth century [in Egypt itself]. Al-Ghazali reached adulthood when there had already been almost three decades of women\u2019s activism in Egypt.\u201d3 There was also a proliferation of women\u2019s publications around 1900 that \u201cwas accompanied by an efflorescence of women\u2019s charitable associations, which served as the springboard for women\u2019s entry into public and political life.\u201d4 This Egyptian timeline is concurrent to, and squarely resonant with, first wave feminism in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom, as well as the rise of women\u2019s central role in providing charity that accompanied feminist movements in the Global North. In Europe and white settler colonies, histories of feminism and social work tend to be mapped onto stories of progress, which are framed as a movement away from religion and towards secularism (whether or not that fits with historical figures\u2019 understandings). Indeed, as Sherene Razack observes, \u201cthe secular/religious divide . . . functions as a color line, marking the difference between the modern, enlightened West, and people of color, notably Muslims.\u201d5 This blueprint for historical progress doesn\u2019t map well onto developments in Egypt \u2013 and not because secularism was unavailable as an option. \u201cZaynab al-Ghazali\u2019s first exposure to women\u2019s activism came at the age of sixteen when she joined the Egyptian Feminist Union (EFU), an affiliation that she reportedly later terminated because of the EFU\u2019s \u2018secular orientation.\u2019\u201d6 In reading about al-Ghazali\u2019s treatment of gender relations, it may be easy for many white readers to imagine that secular feminism is a better path towards justice. For example, \u201cthe language of \u2018women\u2019s rights\u2019 finds an important \u2026 place in al-Ghazali\u2019s speeches and writings and is often invoked to emphasize that Muslim women and men are equally called upon to serve God,\u201d7 a priority that may seem misaligned to a secular reader. However, Mahmood demonstrates the profound changes that al-Ghazali and Islamic women\u2019s movements have had on gender relations in Egypt. In her conclusion, she challenges readers with the spectre of genocide, which she suggests is implicit in secular framings of non-secular ways of being: she invites her readers to consider \u201cthat analysis as a mode of conversation [across difference], rather than mastery, can yield a vision of coexistence that does not require making other lifeworlds extinct or provisional.\u201d8 Is it possible for secular white readers in the Global North to imagine that Muslim Egyptian navigations of gender relations are just as legitimate and potentially transformative as those that are valued within secular feminism? Furthermore, what would it mean to take seriously Mahmood\u2019s challenge that we tend to approach difference as something we implicitly aim to make \u201cextinct?\u201d Histories like al-Ghazali\u2019s are left out of the standard account of social work, which traces white US settlement houses and Charity Organization Society initiatives back to white people\u2019s initiatives in the United Kingdom.9 This chapter offers a small corrective to this tendency. We do not, however, claim to offer a complete account of the story of racialized peoples\u2019 contributions to what has come to be called social work. There will always be examples left out, and our account is no exception. However, by foregrounding and naming these exclusions, and by making humble correctives to a few such exclusions, we hope to offer a context for thinking further about the kinds of interventions into the social world that are normally left out of social work history. We aim to show that these exclusions are arbitrary, in the sense of being unjustifiable; yet, at the same time, they are logically coherent within the framework of white supremacy and have real effects on people\u2019s lives and possibilities. They are arbitrary because there is no objective reason to privilege white people\u2019s accomplishments and to leave out those of racialized communities; but they are perfectly sensible and coherent within the moral economy of white supremacy. White supremacy shapes both the inclusions and the exclusions of the standard account of social work\u2019s origin. In response to these exclusions, this chapter highlights some innovations, contributions, and legacies that racialized communities have made, focusing on Black communities in the United States and Canada. The standard account of social work is simply a white account of white social work.* It ignores racialized peoples\u2019 contributions to the mishmash of interventions into our social world that has been called social work for over a century, and thus constructs social work as white in both the past and the present. The few historical figures we name, alongside countless Black anti-slavery and anti-lynching advocates, community organizers, settlement workers, and other activists and charity workers, were active in forging the foundation of modern social work. Yet, it\u2019s only recently that early Black social workers like Ida B. Wells, Mary Ann Shadd Cary, Mary Church Terrell, Reverdy Ransom, and Maggie Walker are having their histories told or read in contexts where there aren\u2019t exclusively Black students, and where these historical figures are understood to be the originators of social work (as opposed to only the originators of Black social work) that they really were. If we understand social work to include various forms of relief initiatives, as well as diverse actions aiming towards community and large-scale political and social transformation \u2013 as with the range of work done at Hull-House or by al-Ghazali and the Society of Muslim Ladies \u2013 then the distinction between what does and does not get officially designated as social work becomes increasingly arbitrary and unjustifiable. As Linda Gordon asserts, \u201cWelfare histories [have] been by definition white-centered.\u201d10 She shows that it\u2019s \u201cpossible to make the widespread welfare reform activity of minority women visible only by changing the definition of the topic and its periodization.\u201d11 Likewise, such a move shifts the understanding of the entirety of social work history. Because social workers are assumed to be white, social work within communities of colour \u2013 including that which inspired later white social workers \u2013 gets almost entirely left out. Before recounting the histories themselves, we might reflect: considering the explicit anti-Black racism and violence that was widespread in Canada and the United States at the time of social work\u2019s nominal emergence, what kinds of efforts would have made sense for Black social workers? This chapter highlights a few stories of people who were engaged in certain kinds of social welfare activity that have not been officially acknowledged as such within histories of social welfare. Histories such as these are frequently dismissed as particular to specific populations. When white people worked with other white people, the particularity wasn\u2019t noted \u2013 whiteness as particularity went unremarked. But Black social work, when discussed at all, tends to be told as Black history rather than part of a collective history. White history is told as a shared history, whereas Black, Indigenous, and racialized histories are normally deemed relevant only to their respective communities. But, considering the social and political context, it made sense for Black social workers to focus on interventions relating specifically to Black communities.* The reasons for this focus include racism, a sense of connection to those communities, a feeling of solidarity with the struggles their own neighbours were experiencing, and the recognition that their neighbours were struggling distinctly, and often more intensely, than white people living nearby (due to racial segregation and the uneven distribution of resources that has always accompanied it in practice12). Black social work was no more particular or insular than work being done within white communities. Yet Black social work, and its contributions to the world we live in, continues to be largely unacknowledged by white recorders of history, which of course includes white recorders of social work history. When white social work was first emerging, a strong and diverse tradition of Black social work was also emerging. Jane Addams is championed as the founder of radical social work, and her anti-racism is used as a prime example of how she lived her political commitments. At the same time (and earlier), however, there were massive organizing efforts on the part of Black people who were pivotal in founding radical social work. If we relieve Addams of some of the responsibility for carrying the entire tradition of social justice\u2013oriented social work practice, we can look to other historical figures and social work movements to see that alternative approaches to helping have always existed \u2013 including among professional social workers. Iris Carlton-LaNey points out that when social work was laying down its roots in white America, Black people were developing a \u201cparallel social welfare system.\u201d13 Because of racist segregation policies, many Black people could not access white social welfare programs, and Black service providers were not welcome in the majority of white organizations. In this context, Black communities\u2019 efforts focused on what at the time was referred to as \u201cracial uplift,\u201d and a number of originators of Black social work believed that Black people should deliver services for Black people. Ida B. Wells, for instance, wrote: \u201cThe Afro-American can do for himself what no one else can do for him.\u201d14 Black communities organized benefit programs, schools, adult education initiatives, community centres, healthcare clinics, homeless shelters, settlement houses, seniors\u2019 homes, youth programs, parenting education, daycares, kindergartens, recreation programs, job banks, clothing banks, ice banks, food banks, and bank banks. And yet, white people providing these types of services to white people at this time is what is called the origin of social work. Therefore, we can ask: Who gets to tell history? Who are its imagined and actual audiences? Who gets cast as the protagonists or primary characters in the stories that are told, and how does this choice affect the take-up of these stories among diverse audiences? Who benefits from these histories being told in the ways that they\u2019re told? And what role do these versions of history have in furthering the moral economies that continue to accumulate moral worth for white subjects and denigrate the imagined value of people of colour? Black Churches: Bestowing Charity and Organizing for Change There are limitless forms by which people help one another. However, resonating with Egyptian developments at this time, two of the key sites in which help became organized and formalized in Black communities were churches (especially those associated with the social gospel movement) and women\u2019s clubs (which were either secular or attached to a religious institution). The church therefore played a key role in the development of Black social work. In white social work, \u201csocial work tended to fill spaces left by the reduced role of religion in everyday life,\u201d15 but organized religion played a more central role in Black social work. This situation arose not only because of the role that organized religion played in the development of charity and aid, which also heavily influenced white social work, but also for reasons particular to Black communities. In many Black communities, churches were the only available community spaces. In many places in the United States, it was illegal for Black people to congregate in groups of more than\n\nChapman, Chris; Withers, A.J..

Edi\u00e7\u00e3o do Kindle. five people other than at church, which meant that organizing was criminalized outside of the church. According to Carter G. Woodson, a prominent Black intellectual at the time, churches were \u201cthe only institution in which [Black people could] freely exercise authority\u201d16 and pursue strategies of self-determination and self-governance.* As a result of these factors, churches were important spaces for community organizing, and they ran numerous social and political programs alongside their more traditional role of providing relief to poor people.17 Some Black people, however, were critical of the role of organized religion. W.E.B. Du Bois, for example, disparaged Black churches for not doing enough to help Black communities. In 1912, he wrote in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) publication The Crisis that the church was \u201cstill building churches when people need homes and schools, and persisting in crucifying critics rather than realizing the handwriting on the wall.\u201d18 At the same time, he recognized the importance of churches and their centrality in Black communities.19 In the conclusion to an extensive study he led on the Black church, Du Bois, with Mary Church Tyrell and Kelly Miller, recognized the significance of the church as \u201ca mighty social power,\u201d but also asserted \u201cit needs cleansing; reviving and inspiring.\u201d20 One of the key influences of social work and the helping professions in Canada and the United States was the social gospel movement.21 Social gospel originated as a reaction to the social and economic devastation that industrial capitalism caused and the absence of an appropriate response from conventional Christianity.22 Made up of radical and progressive Protestants, the movement engaged in a variety of social welfare programs. Many social change\u2013oriented churches throughout the United States implemented important social programs.23 The Institutional Church in Chicago, under the leadership of Black Reverend Reverdy C. Ransom, is one example of the social gospel movement in action. Ransom and his congregation built a settlement house that opened in 1900 and was designed to cater to the needs of the Black community.24 Ransom was a radical, encouraging people to think about adopting socialism, which he saw as a solution to racism.25 He also worked to help settle conflicts between white strikers and Black strikebreakers in Chicago.26 Resonantly, Woodson describes how a Congregational church in Massachusetts under the leadership of W.N. DeBerry established \u201ca free employment bureau, a women\u2019s welfare league, a night school of domestic training, a girls\u2019 and a boys\u2019 club emphasizing the handicrafts, music, and athletics.\u201d27 Similar programs existed in progressive Black churches across the United States and Canada.28 The social gospel movement worked in both white and Black communities to deal with the material crises that people experienced. In addition to increasing people\u2019s access to education, childcare, settlement houses, homeless shelters, and other social services,29 the social gospel movement also worked towards large-scale political change.* Carter G. Woodson, known as the \u201cFather of Black History,\u201d30 referred to the work of social gospellers as \u201csocial work\u201d in The History of the Negro Church in 1921. \u201cSeparate Spheres\u201d and Women\u2019s Clubs Following the social disruptions caused in Europe and white settler spaces by capitalist industrialization and urbanization, a new discourse of gendered mores, norms, and values emerged. This new arrangement, referred to as \u201cseparate spheres,\u201d was a system which held that respectable men and women should only occupy roles then considered gender appropriate. The resultant separation between men and women was helpful in creating possibilities for love-based companionships among ruling class women at the time, known as \u201cBoston marriages\u201d (which we discuss in the next chapter).31 It was oppressive in many other ways, however, and it furthered the moral economy of differentiated human value \u2013 valuing the supposedly men\u2019s sphere over the women\u2019s sphere. According to separate spheres discourse and mores, the public domain (politics, paid work, and so on) was to be peopled exclusively by men, and the private domain (household and family) was to be exclusively women\u2019s domain.32 These supposedly \u201ctraditional\u201d ideas have a much more recent history than we tend to think. Previously in Europe, although gender roles were segregated, local community norms and immediate family needs largely governed how, where, and with whom people spent their time. The home had often been the location of economic activity, whether for farming or cottage industries, and men and women, boys and girls would often work alongside one another on many day-to-day tasks. The notion that men should work for pay and women should tend to the home and care for the family was at best inconsistently followed, and there was no sense that it was morally superior to always segregate genders. In response to the moral panic arising due to the increased personal freedom that resulted from capitalist industrialization and urbanization, separate spheres discourse arose to police interactions between men and women. It was essentially a moral discourse. In order to demonstrate oneself as respectable, a person would only ever labour in ways then considered gender appropriate. Alongside shifting the norms and mores within ruling class culture itself, this change enabled yet another way for poor and racialized people, especially women, to be looked down upon as morally inferior: female slaves and poor women of any race could not abstain from the \u201cpublic\u201d or \u201cmen\u2019s sphere\u201d of labouring for others. Poor women worked outside of their homes to survive,33 and, obviously, slaves could not freely choose how to direct their labour. Thus, ruling class women\u2019s respectability and morality increasingly relied upon differentiating themselves from women who cooked, cleaned, and provided care in other people\u2019s homes and were considered inferior for doing so.34 Relatively well-off Black women, before and after emancipation, often demonstrated their respectability and full humanity by adhering to the dominant social mores of separate spheres. Black communities frequently adopted all or part of separate spheres norms and discourse. Of Black Nova Scotians, for example, Suzanne Morton writes: \u201cGender ideology that placed women in the home offered protection and dignity within their own community, even if it could not secure recognition from the white middle class.\u201d35 Harley explains the adherence to separate spheres norms in the context of the post-emancipation US South: \u201cGender-defined work and domestic responsibilities were symbolic of their new status.\u201d He argues that, within a white supremacist and patriarchal society, \u201csex-segregation helped to protect black women, married or single, from charges of immorality such as those made by nineteenth- and twentieth-century writers and reformers.\u201d36 The performance of separate spheres allowed select Black people to establish membership in the new middle class, which Marie Louise Fellows and Sherene Razack describe as gaining \u201ca toehold on respectability.\u201d37 Although white supremacy and patriarchy continued to shape and define their lives and possibilities, some Black women were able to accumulate the social markers of the bourgeois class (certain kinds of dress and education, avoiding labour considered unbecoming for a lady, and so on) through which they precariously entered the ranks of the middle class. As in white communities, separate spheres mores intersected with the rise of the middle class professions, which shaped selective opportunities for women to enter the public sphere \u2013 but only in roles related to the direction and surveillance of the private sphere. Women occupied paid positions in nursing, childhood education, and social welfare activities, but only rarely in more squarely male-gendered professions such as law or medicine. In Black communities, the transition to women occupying leadership roles within the female-gendered spheres seems to have been smoother than in white communities. For instance, Shirley Yee writes: \u201cBlack women often worked with Black men in building institutions that were critical to daily life. Black women\u2019s involvement in the establishment of churches, schools, and mutual aid societies reflected a long legacy of cooperation between Black men and women.\u201d She shows how \u201cBlack Canadian women continually blurred the line between public and private and tailored their own notions of \u2018true\u2019 womanhood to the realities they faced in daily life.\u201d38 In both Canada and the United States, according to Yee, \u201cthe adoption of patriarchal structures that ironically symbolized freedom also illustrated the pervasiveness of sex role ideology.\u201d However, this ideology was resisted too \u2013 or at least it was navigated in ways that seem to have been unique to Black communities: \u201cThrough their public activism, Black women maintained the interconnectedness of family and community, the private and the public \u2013 between which there was little distinction\u201d in their real lives.39 Their ability to interconnect may have been because Black women had always worked in the \u201cpublic sphere,\u201d and these social mores were only newly available to them; and it may have also reflected distinct (and surely internally diverse) gender mores and norms that had been brought over from West Africa and were preserved through slavery.40 During this time, women\u2019s clubs were one public forum for women to engage in the social governance of the private realm, discussing and acting on issues that were deemed gender-role appropriate. The 1890s saw a wave of clubs emerge in the United States that were focused not only on the home, but also on social and political reform.41 In this decade alone, clubs emerged in New York, Boston, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Jefferson City, Omaha, New Orleans, Knoxville, and Providence \u2013 and likely in smaller communities as well.42 In 1896, the National Association of Colored Women was founded by activists including Ida B. Wells-Barnett, Mary Church Terrell, Francis Harper, and Harriet Tubman, bringing Black women\u2019s clubs from across the country into a coalition.43 Women\u2019s clubs of this era were largely focused on individual and community betterment, which they called racial uplift.44 Clubs also served as a training ground for women to obtain community work and social service skills.45 With some important exceptions, these clubs were run by middle and upper class Black women, who could follow separate spheres mores for women46 and often had a college education.47 Women\u2019s clubs typically espoused domestic feminism, which, according to Nancy Cott, is \u201cwomen\u2019s assertion of private power (particularly reproductive control) within their families.\u201d48 Club women, according to Anne Meis Knupfer, \u201cperceived their roles of mother, wife, and homemaker as cornerstones to \u2018race uplift\u2019 and progress.\u201d49 They founded orphanages, settlement houses, youth clubs, kindergartens, women\u2019s education opportunities, employment services, youth/recreational programs, nursing homes, daycares, and at least one YWCA.50 Notably, these programs were all in keeping with the ideologies of domestic feminism and separate spheres. Club women helped establish many important social services and worked towards strengthening the Black community, always in keeping with those arenas of life in which it was normatively deemed appropriate for women to participate. The social and political effects of the work of Black women\u2019s clubs, like the concrete effects of Addams\u2019s and Richmond\u2019s work, were therefore complicated. They provided crucial programs and resources to communities that were usually excluded from white social work services, but they also acted to police morality and gender roles. Women\u2019s clubs worked towards reform and progress, but they also confined social service providers and recipients alike to gender roles deemed appropriate according to classed and racialized social mores.* The Great Migration: Migrant Assistance and the Shift towards Black Incarceration The \u201cGreat Migration\u201d began around 1915 and, according to Isabel Wilkerson, was \u201ca statistically measurable demographic phenomenon marked by unabated outflows of black \u00e9migr\u00e9s\u201d to Northern US states.51 In order to support the many people who were arriving in cities in the North, often incredibly poor and in need of assistance, Black people set up a number of welfare programs.52 One of the key areas of assistance was with women from the South, many of whom were targeted by predatory employment agencies that would force them into debt and, at times, horrendous working conditions. Black (and sometimes white) social workers were sent out to assist with directions, funds, a place to stay, and advocacy.53 The largest organization working with Black migrants from the South in this period was the National Urban League (NUL).54 Black social worker and social work educator George Haynes founded and led the NUL, which Elmer Martin and Joanne Mitchell Martin say had the \u201cleading, most advanced black social workers.\u201d55 The NUL monitored existing relief programs, advocating for Black people who had been treated unjustly.56 They worked to ensure economic access to Black people, which involved combatting racism and difficult social and material conditions,",

According to Carter G. Woodson, a prominent Black intellectual at the time, churches were \u201cthe only institution in which [Black people could] freely exercise authority\u201d16 and pursue strategies of self-determination and self-governance.* As a result of these factors, churches were important spaces for community organizing, and they ran numerous social and political programs alongside their more traditional role of providing relief to poor people.17 Some Black people, however, were critical of the role of organized religion. W.E.B. Du Bois, for example, disparaged Black churches for not doing enough to help Black communities. In 1912, he wrote in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) publication The Crisis that the church was \u201cstill building churches when people need homes and schools, and persisting in crucifying critics rather than realizing the handwriting on the wall.\u201d18 At the same time, he recognized the importance of churches and their centrality in Black communities.19 In the conclusion to an extensive study he led on the Black church, Du Bois, with Mary Church Tyrell and Kelly Miller, recognized the significance of the church as \u201ca mighty social power,\u201d but also asserted \u201cit needs cleansing; reviving and inspiring.\u201d20 One of the key influences of social work and the helping professions in Canada and the United States was the social gospel movement.21 Social gospel originated as a reaction to the social and economic devastation that industrial capitalism caused and the absence of an appropriate response from conventional Christianity.22 Made up of radical and progressive Protestants, the movement engaged in a variety of social welfare programs. Many social change\u2013oriented churches throughout the United States implemented important social programs.23 The Institutional Church in Chicago, under the leadership of Black Reverend Reverdy C. Ransom, is one example of the social gospel movement in action. Ransom and his congregation built a settlement house that opened in 1900 and was designed to cater to the needs of the Black community.24 Ransom was a radical, encouraging people to think about adopting socialism, which he saw as a solution to racism.25 He also worked to help settle conflicts between white strikers and Black strikebreakers in Chicago.26 Resonantly, Woodson describes how a Congregational church in Massachusetts under the leadership of W.N. DeBerry established \u201ca free employment bureau, a women\u2019s welfare league, a night school of domestic training, a girls\u2019 and a boys\u2019 club emphasizing the handicrafts, music, and athletics.\u201d27 Similar programs existed in progressive Black churches across the United States and Canada.28 The social gospel movement worked in both white and Black communities to deal with the material crises that people experienced. In addition to increasing people\u2019s access to education, childcare, settlement houses, homeless shelters, and other social services,29 the social gospel movement also worked towards large-scale political change.* Carter G. Woodson, known as the \u201cFather of Black History,\u201d30 referred to the work of social gospellers as \u201csocial work\u201d in The History of the Negro Church in 1921. \u201cSeparate Spheres\u201d and Women\u2019s Clubs Following the social disruptions caused in Europe and white settler spaces by capitalist industrialization and urbanization, a new discourse of gendered mores, norms, and values emerged. This new arrangement, referred to as \u201cseparate spheres,\u201d was a system which held that respectable men and women should only occupy roles then considered gender appropriate. The resultant separation between men and women was helpful in creating possibilities for love-based companionships among ruling class women at the time, known as \u201cBoston marriages\u201d (which we discuss in the next chapter).31 It was oppressive in many other ways, however, and it furthered the moral economy of differentiated human value \u2013 valuing the supposedly men\u2019s sphere over the women\u2019s sphere. According to separate spheres discourse and mores, the public domain (politics, paid work, and so on) was to be peopled exclusively by men, and the private domain (household and family) was to be exclusively women\u2019s domain.32 These supposedly \u201ctraditional\u201d ideas have a much more recent history than we tend to think. Previously in Europe, although gender roles were segregated, local community norms and immediate family needs largely governed how, where, and with whom people spent their time. The home had often been the location of economic activity, whether for farming or cottage industries, and men and women, boys and girls would often work alongside one another on many day-to-day tasks. The notion that men should work for pay and women should tend to the home and care for the family was at best inconsistently followed, and there was no sense that it was morally superior to always segregate genders. In response to the moral panic arising due to the increased personal freedom that resulted from capitalist industrialization and urbanization, separate spheres discourse arose to police interactions between men and women. It was essentially a moral discourse. In order to demonstrate oneself as respectable, a person would only ever labour in ways then considered gender appropriate. Alongside shifting the norms and mores within ruling class culture itself, this change enabled yet another way for poor and racialized people, especially women, to be looked down upon as morally inferior: female slaves and poor women of any race could not abstain from the \u201cpublic\u201d or \u201cmen\u2019s sphere\u201d of labouring for others. Poor women worked outside of their homes to survive,33 and, obviously, slaves could not freely choose how to direct their labour. Thus, ruling class women\u2019s respectability and morality increasingly relied upon differentiating themselves from women who cooked, cleaned, and provided care in other people\u2019s homes and were considered inferior for doing so.34 Relatively well-off Black women, before and after emancipation, often demonstrated their respectability and full humanity by adhering to the dominant social mores of separate spheres. Black communities frequently adopted all or part of separate spheres norms and discourse. Of Black Nova Scotians, for example, Suzanne Morton writes: \u201cGender ideology that placed women in the home offered protection and dignity within their own community, even if it could not secure recognition from the white middle class.\u201d35 Harley explains the adherence to separate spheres norms in the context of the post-emancipation US South: \u201cGender-defined work and domestic responsibilities were symbolic of their new status.\u201d He argues that, within a white supremacist and patriarchal society, \u201csex-segregation helped to protect black women, married or single, from charges of immorality such as those made by nineteenth- and twentieth-century writers and reformers.\u201d36 The performance of separate spheres allowed select Black people to establish membership in the new middle class, which Marie Louise Fellows and Sherene Razack describe as gaining \u201ca toehold on respectability.\u201d37 Although white supremacy and patriarchy continued to shape and define their lives and possibilities, some Black women were able to accumulate the social markers of the bourgeois class (certain kinds of dress and education, avoiding labour considered unbecoming for a lady, and so on) through which they precariously entered the ranks of the middle class.

Edi\u00e7\u00e3o do Kindle. conditions, and to reframe Southern Black migrants as skilled workers in the ruling class social imagination. The NUL advocated for Black migrants to become \u201cskilled, unionized industrial workers [who would be fully integrated] into the urban political economy.\u201d57 Yet, this goal was accomplished by working to assimilate the migrants to Northern and middle class mores and sensibilities. This approach, according to Martin and Martin, led to social workers focusing on changing individuals to adapt to existing social structures rather than working to change unjust social systems58 \u2013 as with most social services at the time. The demographic and social shift of the Great Migration also marked an important point in previously all-white \u201cservices\u201d that were now available to, and imposed upon, Black people. Sharon Snyder and David Mitchell discuss the profound differences in the institutionalization of communities based on race. Once slavery was abolished, the US state began the mass incarceration of Black people; by the start of the Great Migration, Black people made up the majority of people incarcerated in prisons and asylums. Due to racist segregation, Black people hadn\u2019t previously been institutionalized in poor houses and asylums during much of the nineteenth century, but this policy shifted post-emancipation, and Black people became increasingly pathologized. By 1919, for example, the political phenomena of diagnosing \u201cfeeblemindedness was so prevalent among African American children that all the black schools in one southern Georgia county had been closed.\u201d59 Now, articulated through the new eugenics discourse, all Black children were said to be uneducable. Snyder and Mitchell describe how the white supremacist pathologization of the entire population of Black people as feebleminded \u201cserved to disqualify the population as viable candidates for eugenically based [individualistic] interventions.\u201d They write that Black people therefore \u201clargely escaped the devastation of eugenics-based practices,\u201d and, as a result, it was only in \u201cthe late 1940s [that] African Americans with disabilities begin to be institutionalized along with their white counterparts.\u201d60 While this pattern seems true of medically justified institutionalization, they also observe that the mass imprisonment of Black people had begun earlier. At this time, any gender-segregated confinement was commonly rationalized as a form of eugenics with the explicitly intended effect of keeping people from reproducing. These early justifications should be kept in mind when reflecting upon the political function of prisons and other closed institutions today. From the beginning of the Great Migration, Black communities organized to provide \u201coutdoor relief,\u201d which allowed people to access goods and resources while remaining free from confinement; at the same time, white communities were beginning to massively confine many Black people in the asylums and prisons that were a legacy of an earlier move towards the \u201cindoor relief\u201d of poor white people. As was the case with the earlier shift among denigrated Europeans and white settlers,* the massive use of confinement came about because it became increasingly socially unacceptable for white people to openly and publicly kill and torture Black people,61 due to the efforts of early Black social working and activism. This new use of confinement as a primary means of the racist social control of Black people also coincided closely with the mass confinement of Indigenous children in the Indian residential school system, which the government of the Province of Canada took on as a major policy initiative in the 1840s;62 it was now also becoming increasingly socially unacceptable for white people to openly and publicly kill and torture Indigenous people.63 So, while it is true that Black, Indigenous, and racialized people largely escaped the specific violences of early eugenic policies and practices,64 this \u201cescape\u201d carries a very different meaning if intersected with concurrent histories of anti-Black lynching, western expansion, and the Indian Wars. Once such overt racialized violence became increasingly less acceptable, imprisonment, institutionalization, and Indian residential schools were massively used against racialized and Indigenous populations.65 Continuities can therefore be traced between plantation slavery and today\u2019s seemingly entirely distinct institutions of anti-Black racism. For example, Malcolm X recalled his childhood involvement with state welfare workers as so fundamentally characterized by white people shaming his mother that he considered it a legacy of rampant white shaming, denigration, and control of Black mothers during slavery; he also notes another continuity of slavery in the fact that he became the legal property of the white state once apprehended, with white social workers controlling where he lived and what he did.66 Anti-racist activists have also drawn connections between slavery and what was only then becoming today\u2019s prison system. Although US slavery was abolished in 1865 through the Thirteenth Amendment, the same legislative act named the enslavement of convicts an exception: \u201cNeither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\u201d67 This law enabled two already existing systems of violence and control to intersect and maintain the exploitation of Black labour. Laws in the North and South that targeted free Black people already existed, enabling Black people to be arrested and punished for things that no white person was criminalized for doing. Following slavery abolition, this persecution intensified with the Black Codes of 1865 and 1866.68 These codes intersected with another violent system that previously mostly targeted white convicts and hadn\u2019t yet been an instrument of anti-Black racism. The convict lease system allowed convicts to be \u201cleased\u201d to companies and forced to engage in unpaid labour (the state was paid a small sum for their labour but prisoners received nothing). Post-emancipation, in tandem with the Black Codes and the continued legality of enslaving convicts according to the Thirteenth Amendment, the convict lease system enabled the enslavement of many Black people. In 1892, Ida B. Wells documented conditions within this racist system: \u201cIn one camp it is stated that the mortality is 10 per cent per month, and in another even more than that. In these camps men and women are found chained together.\u201d She also reported: \u201cMen who failed to perform their task of mining from two to four tons of coal per day were fastened to planks by the feet, then bent over a barrel and fastened by the hands on the other side, stripped and beaten with a strap.\u201d69 Although fewer people were subjected to this system than had been subjected to slavery, the experiences of those subjected to convict leasing weren\u2019t particularly different from slavery. A similar pattern of reform functioning simply to reorganize power followed the civil rights gains and abolition of legal racial segregation a century later. One racist system was abolished, and other long-existing systems of control and violence (previously used mostly against marginalized white people) now became mobilized in anti-Black racism: \u201cchild protective systems\u201d didn\u2019t normatively target Black families until the end of racial segregation,70 psychiatry began to target folks active in Black Power movements, so that \u201cschizophrenia became a Black disease;\u201d71 and the US prison system has expanded monumentally since the gains of Black Power movements. There\u2019s a clear relationship between the inheritances of slavery and the ongoing white supremacist structural violence of the prison system. Due to the specific context of the historical emergence of the prison and the shared characteristics of certain power relations in slavery and imprisonment, Angela Davis invites her readers to consider: \u201cIs racism so deeply entrenched in the institution of the prison that it is not possible to eliminate one without eliminating the other?\u201d72 In addition to continuities dating back to slavery in today\u2019s anti-Black racism, new racist stories emerged in the wake of slavery abolition that serve to pre-empt and delegitimize critique of the white supremacist prison system. Post-emancipation, Black people were subjected to the tremendously harsh and arbitrary Black Codes and thus were incarcerated as a result of structural anti-Black racism rather than due to committing a disproportionate number of crimes. However, critique was pre-empted within white consciousness when \u201cduring the 1870s the growing number of black prisoners in the South further buttressed the belief that African Americans were inherently criminal.\u201d73 This belief dovetailed with concurrent developments in eugenic criminology that claimed to scientifically prove that some people were \u201cborn criminals.\u201d74 While eugenic criminology tended to target marginalized white people (due perhaps to the continuous violence of anti-Black lynching and the eugenic belief that every single Black person is unfit75), the notion of an inherent criminality intersected with new discourses of anti-Black racism at the time of slavery abolition. As a result, we\u2019ve inherited and continue to perpetuate the enduring, false, and clearly racist notion that Black people are more prone to crime than white people. Black Settlement Houses Settlement houses were also founded in Black communities during the Progressive Era. The standard account of the development of social work depicts settlement houses as following a model imported from the United Kingdom, but Ralph Luker argues that these institutions were strongly influenced by missions established by Northern Black churches in the South starting in 1869, six years after slavery was abolished in the United States. These missions shared similar ideas and practices, and sometimes staff. Luker calls these Black missions \u201cproto-settlement houses.\u201d Many were developed by Black religious organizations, others by white religious or philanthropic organizations.76 These \u201cproto-settlement houses\u201d were created to address the difficulties many Black people in the South faced post-emancipation, and they preceded the first settlement house in the world (Toynbee Hall, in London, England) by fifteen years. In 1890, the year after Jane Addams and Ellen Gates Starr founded Hull-House, Janie Barrett founded the Locust Street Settlement in Virginia, which is officially the first \u201csettlement house\u201d for Black people.77 The timeline, however, may prove a little more complicated. The Locust Street Settlement grew out of a service Barrett had been providing in her own home for several years previous to this point.78 But Hull-House didn\u2019t emerge the previous year with the breadth of services it would later come to offer; it started much more humbly, initially only providing childcare for working women.79 What this complication means is that Barrett had initiated some of the work, later called the settlement work of the Locust Street Settlement, several years before Addams had even devised the idea of opening a \u201csettlement house\u201d of her own. Does that timeline mean Barrett should get credit for the first US settlement house? Maybe, maybe not.* But it certainly makes a difference to how this history tends to be framed. As discussed in the previous chapter, origin stories matter. They make a difference to how social work is conceived, how race is conceived, and how the two are imagined to intersect with one another. If Hull-House was only the first American \u201csettlement house\u201d in name, or even only \u201cthe first white settlement house,\u201d as opposed to being the first settlement house in terms of what it did, then surely this alternative timeline complicates the account that tends to be told about the birth of social work. If concrete and acknowledged antecedents to settlement work are found in earlier Black social interventions, this finding complicates accounts we tend to tell about a number of things, from social work to the role of Black people in shaping the world more generally. At least eleven Black communities had settlement houses by 1910, and several had more than one (Philadelphia had at least three). Black missions or settlements (the name is significant: \u201cmissions\u201d underscores that these predated Hull-House and even Toynbee Hall; \u201csettlements\u201d mobilizes the moral economies of white supremacy and secularism to bestow a certain legitimacy to this Black \u201csocial work\u201d) provided a plethora of services and programs, including schools for students and future teachers, healthcare services, agricultural conferences, mothers\u2019 meetings, short-term housing, daycare, and the distribution of coal and food. Some also conducted social science studies of the Black communities they served.80 Woman\u2019s Christian Temperance Union Another important part of social work history that often gets left out of the standard account is temperance organizing. In the mid- to late nineteenth century, the temperance movement was large and very influential. The largest temperance organization was the Woman\u2019s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), founded in 1874. The WCTU had a massive woman-run publishing operation \u2013 producing 125,000 pages in 1890. In Canada, the first WCTU chapter was founded in Ontario in 1877; the Dominion WCTU, Canada\u2019s national organization, was founded in 1888. The Canadian WCTUs were modelled after and mentored by the American WCTU and had their strongest support in rural areas.\n\nChapman, Chris; Withers, A.J.. A Violent History of Benevolence: Interlocking Oppression in the Moral Economies of Social Working (pp. 086-091). University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division. Edi\u00e7\u00e3o do Kindle. After only three years, the Dominion WCTU had nearly 10,000 members, and in 1914 it had nearly 17,000. The WCTU in the United States was made up of autonomous local organizations, some of which were mixed race while others were racially segregated. In the South, it was commonplace to have segregated unions; generally, Black unions were called \u201cnumber two.\u201d81 Therefore, both of the following are true: white supremacy ensured that Black women were considered second class in the national unions and broader social structures;82 and Black women were active in WCTUs and made important contributions to the organization and the temperance movement more broadly.83 It is important to acknowledge the exaltation of white women in the leadership of the organization, as well as to recognize that Black women played significant roles in it. The most prominent Black woman in the WCTU was Francis Harper. She became the superintendent of Work Among the Colored People of the North in 1883, a position she held for several years. Alison Parker explains that Harper and other Black women were attracted to the WCTU because of \u201cits commitment to national legislation and federal solutions to moral and social problems in the United States.\u201d84 Harper strove towards interracial cooperation and travelled the country advocating for it within the WCTU and Black temperance activism more generally. Harper supported women\u2019s suffrage and viewed white women as important potential allies. She advocated for and had some (limited) success in having more Black representation in the national governing bodies of the WCTU.85 The WCTU and other temperance organizations did a great deal of the kinds of work that those who are credited as founding social work were also doing. Like Hull-House, the WCTU was headquartered in Chicago and did social work such as operating homes for \u201cfallen women,\u201d establishing kindergartens, providing vocational training, advocating for better care for orphaned children, engaging in prison and policing reform projects (which included calls for police matrons and forced prison labour), providing educational programs for mothers and children, and advocating for legislation reform to protect girls.86 The WCTU also worked to lay the groundwork for women to become more prominent in political reform. Significantly, Francis Willard, the long-time leader of the WCTU, called the work of the WCTU \u201csocial work.\u201d* Why then would the WCTU be left out of the standard account of social work history? Carol Mattingly posits that the WCTU is largely excluded from feminist history because of \u201ccontemporary scholars\u2019 discomfort with temperance women\u2019s religious/evangelical associations.\u201d87 This theory seems likely in relation to social work history, whether feminist or otherwise, due to the normative notion that progress over the last few centuries has mapped onto increasing secularism. From a contemporary standpoint, temperance organizing is a political anomaly: these women often used direct action protest tactics and were religious zealots. They viewed all social issues as caused by a single thing \u2013 alcohol (and sometimes other drugs like tobacco) \u2013 and they believed that eliminating this vice would solve social problems such as poverty and violence against women. Indeed, Frances Willard quoted Richard Cobden: \u201cTemperance Reform lies at the foundation of all reforms.\u201d88 Perhaps seemingly paradoxical by contemporary standards, Sharon Cook argues that the WCTU\u2019s \u201cconservative ideas of family relationships could, and did, result in progressive demands.\u201d89 As a prime example, the WCTU led what may have been the earliest mass campaign against men\u2019s violence against women and children \u2013 still a central social work issue today. The WCTU rallied around the watchword \u201chome protection,\u201d coined by Canadian WCTU leader Letitia Youmans. Willard made this watchword a guiding principle for the organization.90 Towards the end of the nineteenth century, alcohol consumption had been constructed as masculine with, according to Cook, \u201cits most destructive impact on the home and the often defenceless family.\u201d91 Alcohol was blamed for men\u2019s desertion of their wives and children, poverty, domestic violence, and sexual assault. The WCTU saw eliminating alcohol as removing the root cause of all these problems. The WCTU circulated petitions against the assault on women and girls, and the organization\u2019s members attended criminal trials in support of female victims of sexual violence. They led campaigns to raise the age of consent in the United States and Canada, and were almost always successful.92 Cook therefore writes that temperance was \u201ca \u2018constellation\u2019 issue,\u201d which included \u201cseveral associated \u2013 and ultimately more important \u2013 concerns, through which women expressed their outrage at male violence and irresponsibility, their fears for the survival of the family unit, and, eventually, their collective demands for legislative solutions to these problems.\u201d93 While blaming alcohol and other intoxicants for men\u2019s violence against women, the WCTU nevertheless also politicized violence against women as a gendered social issue and was seemingly the first large cohesive group that organized to eliminate it. As with many social workers then and now, child protection and well-being were a major WCTU concern. In addition to homes for single mothers and their children, the WCTU worked with children\u2019s aid societies to identify and assist children in need. When a child protection agency was created in Ontario, the WCTU expressed the desire to \u201cgreatly assist by recommending the names of suitable persons to help in this work.\u201d94 In the United States, the Department of Securing Homes for Homeless Children attempted to do just that. Willard wrote: \u201cCooperation with existing Children\u2019s Aid Societies is recommended \u2026 and [they] are glad to welcome us as coadjutors. It is not too much to say that the salvation of our beloved country depends upon the salvation of these children.\u201d95 The WCTU and its youth counterpart, the YWCTU, ran a number of homes for women in the United States. In Canada, Ottawa\u2019s Home for Friendless Women provided shelter for \u201cfallen women\u201d with children, teaching them parenting skills and providing them with basic necessities. In order to stay in the home, women had to agree to live there for one year or more. The program was designed to both punish and rehabilitate these women, in part through long hours of laundry work. The shelter also took in old women. Another shelter was the \u201cFrances E. Willard Home for Girls [which] was a temporary shelter for young women in Toronto founded around 1895.\u201d96 Its 1905 annual report stated: \u201cGirls coming to the city with no definite idea as to employment are counselled to go to private houses as domestics, and situations are usually found for them.\u201d97 In 1903, the Ontario WCTU noted: \u201cOwing to the ever-increasing demand for domestics the average time of the girls in Home is too short to admit of much training, nevertheless we are persuaded that through the sheltering care of the Home and its matron many a soul has been saved from degradation.\u201d98 The Ontario WCTU\u2019s annual reports from 1890 to 1926 also suggest an ongoing interest in working specifically in Black and Indigenous communities.99 While they seem to have imagined that work in Indigenous communities first required contact with white missionaries,* it appears that the position of superintendent for \u201cWork among the Colored People\u201d was inconsistently held by Black and white women.* These reports also suggest a different spin on \u201ctemperance,\u201d which makes sense given the era, but is often left out of what could perhaps be called the standard account of the WCTU. It would seem that their concern about alcohol was, at least in part, a eugenic one. As mentioned earlier, eugenicists believed that social and behavioural influences could shape biology as much as they believed that degeneracy works in the opposite direction. Drinking could thus both cause bad heredity and be caused by bad heredity. Therefore, drinking was believed to lead to many other forms of moral and physical degeneracy. Mrs E. Adelia Lucas served as superintendent of the Ontario WCTU\u2019s Department of Heredity and Hygiene. In 1890, she wrote: \u201cThe sin of bringing into the world diseased and defective children is almost unpardonable, and the sin of marrying and inebriating and having descendants tainted and switched off on to the side-track of ruin is literally a crime that can never be atoned for.\u201d100 The WCTU founded the Department of Heredity and Hygiene to investigate the eugenic causes of alcohol and tobacco consumption, which \u201cwas soon broadened, so as to include all hereditary tendencies, healthful and pure, as well as diseased conditions.\u201d Lucas maintained that these tendencies reflect \u201cone of God\u2019s primal laws for all living things.\u201d101 Her eugenic rhetoric, then, is thoroughly Christian \u2013 undermining the often-assumed analysis that what was considered science displaced religion at this \u201cprogressive\u201d time. The WCTU\u2019s Department of Heredity and Hygiene wove science into its religious world view. Anti-Lynching Lynching, the act of extralegal mob murder, became increasingly commonplace as a racialized form of violence in many parts of the United States following emancipation. Although lynching was not a new practice, for the first time in 1885 there were more lynchings of Black people than white, and this tendency persisted until around the time that Black people began to be institutionalized.102 The year-by-year statistics show a dramatic increase of lynching in general, alongside a decrease in white people who were lynched each year. When Black people were no longer considered the property of individual white people who could punish and kill them at will, mobs of white people began to increasingly murder Black people. This violence was often rationalized by claiming that they were protecting themselves or other whites (particularly the virtue of white women) from crimes committed by Black people. According to Davis, after the Civil War, \u201cwhite supremacy continued to be embraced by vast numbers of people and became deeply inscribed in new institutions. One of these post-slavery institutions was lynching, which was widely accepted for many decades thereafter.\u201d103 Lynching was brutal and torturous; it was also commonplace. A draft of a petition to the federal and state governments in 1918 describes what was going on at the time: The reported causes for such appalling brutality run the gamut from alleged violation of the honor of white women to disputing the word of white men \u2026 [However,] only about five per cent of these murders are reputed to have been inflicted upon accused violators of womanhood \u2026 [so] the desire to protect womanhood is almost negligibly among the so-called causes of lynchings \u2026 May your silence be construed as tacit approval or active tolerance of these things?104 Ida B. Wells-Barnett estimated that 10,000 Black people were lynched in the three decades following the Civil War (1865\u20131895).105 These murders were horrors on multiple levels: they targeted individuals for torture and death, affected families who were left grieving their loved ones and finding themselves in deeper poverty with the loss of their husband or father\u2019s income, and also affected entire communities, in that many Black people knew people who had been lynched or disappeared. That one could be attacked for standing up for oneself, defending oneself, or simply for being Black would have led to persistent fear in the Black community, as it was designed to do. Trigger warning: Please be advised that the following four paragraphs include graphic descriptions of lynchings. Lynchings were often conducted during the day and in public in order to maximize their impact on terrorizing Black populations and constraining them to rigidly racialized social mores. The 1918 anti-lynching petition mentioned earlier, for example, describes one lynching in which a Black man was burned at the stake and \u201can entire helpless colored population was marched around the fire, amid fumes of a burning human being and put on notice that as that black man was suffering they too should fear to suffer.\u201d106 Lynching was explicitly about keeping Black people in fear as a tactic to keep them subordinated. It secured the force of the colour line post-emancipation, socializing both white and Black people to occupy their respective stratified moral and political positions. At the height of anti-Black lynching, white people took photos of mutilated Black bodies and had them mass printed as postcards,107 which were sold at stores and sent through the US postal service.* The rise of anti-Black lynching maps neatly onto the birth and flourishing of eugenics. If not taken as mere coincidence, this intersection suggests a shift in ruling class white morality in Europe and white settler colonies where racialized, poor, disabled, and otherwise oppressed communities were being targeted for eradication in new ways. As poor and disabled white people were increasingly targeted for incarceration and reproductive,",

Of the uneven relationship at the time between anti-Black lynching and disablist eugenics, one illustrative event was the murder of a \u201cseventeen year old boy by the name of Jesse Washington \u2026 in 1916,\u201d which is the year after the cornerstone eugenic criminology text, The Criminal Imbecile, was published.108 James Allen says that Jesse Washington was \u201cseriously mentally challenged. The wife of the farmer he worked for was found dead.\u201d109 Jesse was tried and convicted. From Rafter\u2019s history of eugenic criminology, we might expect that Jesse would have been given an indefinite prison sentence, resulting in a eugenically rationalized lifelong incarceration due to his intellectual disability \u2013 although in Texas, where he was killed, he may have been more likely confined to an asylum for his life. Regardless, neither of these things took place. Instead he was dragged out of the courtroom, kicked down the steps, tortured, burned alive, castrated, had his fingers cut off one by one, and hanged. \u201cThere were 16,000 people crowding the street to watch this boy be tortured \u2026 [T]here were cheers, like at a football game, cheering the torturers on.\u201d Perhaps Jesse was partly targeted because he was disabled, but he was publicly tortured and murdered because he was Black.110 Ida B. Wells-Barnett Black communities fought vigorously to abolish lynching. One of the most prominent anti-lynching activists was Ida B. Wells (Wells-Barnett,\u2020 following her marriage).111 She was also a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the National Association of Colored Women, and was active in the women\u2019s club movement. In 1884, she first gained wide recognition for refusing to move from an all-white train car and for winning a settlement against the railroad.112 Wells wrote a condemnation of lynching in Memphis\u2019s Free Speech and Headlight after her friend Tom Moss was lynched for defending himself from white men\u2019s physical attacks in 1892. Due to the response to this condemnation, she was forced to flee the South. She recalls: \u201cIt was for the assertion of this fact, in the defense of her own race, that the writer hereof became an exile; her property destroyed and her return to her home forbidden under penalty of death.\u201d113 Nevertheless, she continued to agitate against lynching. In 1899, she wrote and circulated a pamphlet, \u201cLynch Law in Georgia,\u201d to Black communities in Chicago. She wrote: \u201cThe real purpose of the savage demonstrations is to teach the Negro that in the south he has no rights that the law will enforce. Samuel House was burned to teach the Negroes that no matter what a white man does to them, they must not resist.\u201d114 In response to dominant framings of anti-Black lynching more generally, and specifically to Jane Addams\u2019s acceptance of this normative white framing in her own condemnation of lynching, Wells demonstrated that most lynchings didn\u2019t involve even a claim* that the murdered man had raped a white woman.115 She showed that many of the lynchings committed on the grounds of sexual assault by Black men against white women were actually white responses to consensual interracial relationships, which were considered unacceptable within interlocking white supremacist patriarchal moral economies.116 White men had only recently lost unmitigated sexual access to the Black women they owned in law, regardless of these women\u2019s desires and consent, with the end of slavery.117 The predominant white account of lynching at the time was that white women were regularly raped by Black men, but Andrea Smith challenges the fictitiousness of this narrative: \u201cIn fact, Black women needed protection from white men.\u201d118 Indeed, Wells-Barnett\u2019s grandmother was a slave and her father a slave-owner\u2019s son \u2013 so he was likely a child who resulted from rape, as was common during slavery.119 Although fictitious, the prevalent notion that white men had to lynch Black men in order to save white women from Black rape was so pervasive that Hollywood\u2019s first blockbuster, The Birth of a Nation, which had the highest grossing ticket sales until Gone with the Wind twenty-four years later,120 depicts what claims to be a historical account of post-Civil War reconstruction and glorifies the founding of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) and a lynching in response to a Black man raping a white woman.121 When considering the views of Smith and Wells-Barnett on lynching Black men accused of raping white women, it\u2019s important to note that white men who raped any woman of any race were never lynched. In fact, most often there was no consequence at all. Contemporary readers should remember this point if they find Wells-Barnett\u2019s handling of rape and sexual assault accusations troubling due to having been socialized within second wave feminism\u2019s crucial politicization of sexual assault and the importance of believing those who say they\u2019ve been sexually assaulted. That indispensable lesson needs to be taken into account, alongside a concern about white supremacist framings of Black and racialized men as particularly prone to rape and other patriarchal violence. Of course, even consensual relationships can involve sexual assault \u2013 a point which could be said to become lost within Wells-Barnett\u2019s claim that the issue pertains to race and not sexual assault as the (interracial) relationship was consensual. (That, said, it was not until the 1970s in the United States122 and in 1983 in Canada123 that men could be held legally responsible for raping their wives.) However, it doesn\u2019t appear Wells-Barnett believed that rape never happened. But she was fighting against the ruse by which rape (real or fictitious) was used to excuse lynching. Like many other Black feminists, Wells-Barnett understood how gender and race interlocked, and she fought against this interlocking oppression rather than against racism or sexism in isolation. Carlton-LaNey writes of such anti-lynching work, saying that Black women at the time \u201crecognize[d] the political nature of sexism long before their white counterparts.\u201d Wells-Barnett and other early Black social workers \u201cfaced the fact that sexual exploitation and violence were perpetuated by both African American and white men.\u201d Carlton-LaNey therefore argues that \u201cpoliticizing sexual exploitation and harassment for African American women placed it squarely within the context of race. Combatting sexual exploitation, therefore, was inextricably linked to race uplift.\u201d124 Early anti-racist feminism did not minimize sexism or sexual assault; rather, it politicized sexism, sexual assault, and responses to them in multiple directions. Andrea Smith begins her chapter \u201cSexual Violence as a Tool of Genocide\u201d by troubling Susan Brownmiller\u2019s second wave white feminist assertion that rape \u201cis nothing more or less than a conscious process of intimidation by which all men keep all women in a state of fear.\u201d Smith uses this statement as a springboard to explore how racism and colonialism shape the particulars of what rape is.125 Likewise, Wells-Barnett was centrally concerned with situating rape and rape discourse within what contemporary feminists call interlocking oppression, as evidenced by her repeated discussions of gender and race and, to a lesser extent, class.126 Such early anti-racist feminist understandings of interlocking oppression trouble the common history of feminism in which interlocking analyses are a recent development initiated by Black feminists such as the Combahee River Collective,127 Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw,128 Patricia Hill Collins,129 Angela Davis,130 Audre Lorde,131 and bell hooks.132 Without minimizing the importance of Black feminism since the 1970s (which often honours earlier Black feminist history), the Black feminist struggle to work against interlocking oppression goes back to the first wave of feminism, which is largely left out of white histories of feminism. It\u2019s not that we wish to reduce the importance of recent anti-racist feminist authors and activists; it\u2019s that remembering the earlier anti-racist feminists raises troubling questions about how feminism\u2019s history up to the 1970s came to be recorded as yet another white history. After fleeing the South, Wells-Barnett organized anti-lynching organizations in a number of states.133 These and other anti-lynching campaigns were hugely influential in Black communities in the United States. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) emerged from anti-lynching activists. Founded in 1909 by a mixture of some of the Black community organizers we\u2019re discussing in this chapter \u2013 Wells-Barnett, Terrell, and Du Bois \u2013 and some white activists (including Addams), the NAACP has worked for racial equality for over a century and is still active today.134 White Social Work and Anti-Lynching Addams and Wells-Barnett were contemporaries and allies in numerous political struggles.135 Although Addams was somewhat exceptional (for a white person) for her commitment to anti-racism, including her activism against lynching, she also accepted that aspects of the white supremacist connection between sexual assault and lynching were true. She was a member of the NAACP at the time, yet she felt entitled to do and say things that appear to have been unaccountable to the experiences of Black communities. According to Wilma Peebles-Wilkins and E. Aracelis Francis, Addams \u201cdid not seem to understand that lynchings involved innocent victims and were not just an unacceptable response to crime.\u201d136 Addams accepted the view that Black men posed a threat to white women and white communities, but objected to lynchings on the grounds that they were not an effective deterrent to this kind of violence and punishment for crimes should be left to the legal system. She also wrote that lynchings were effective in reducing crimes committed by Black men because \u201ccertain elements of the self can be prevented from coming into action,\u201d but pointed out that this inhibition was only a temporary fix because these \u201celements of the self\u201d might resurface.137 Addams\u2019s analysis was shaped by her whiteness and her class positioning, by moral economies of white supremacy, and by discourses stressing the importance of the rule of law and Black men\u2019s criminality. Like Addams, Willard of the WCTU also didn\u2019t understand that lynching was used to control and terrorize Black people. The WCTU refused to allow Wells to address its annual national assembly in 1893. The following year, Wells secured the sponsorship of an organization to ensure that she could address the meeting. She wanted to confront the WCTU\u2019s failure to publicly condemn the lynching of Black men.138 Wells\u2019s insistence on confronting Willard and the WCTU was provoked by an 1890 interview in which Willard made several racist comments about Black people. Willard\u2019s remarks included reiterating the notion that Black men pose a threat to the safety of women and children. She said of white Southerners: \u201cThe problem in their hands is immeasurable. The colored race multiplies like the locusts of Egypt. The grog-shop [liquor store] is a center of power. The safety of women, of childhood, of the home is menaced.\u201d139 Willard thus reiterated the frequent justification of lynching due to the supposed threat that Black men posed to white women. It is particularly concerning that one of the earliest organizations combatting violence against women reified the idea that Black men were exceptionally violent towards women and failed to condemn the racist violence of lynching. When Wells identified Willard\u2019s position as untrue and racist, Willard defended her position. However, she added: I wish I had said then, as I do now, that the immoralities of white men in their relations with colored women are the source of intolerable race prejudice and hatred, and that there is not a more withering curse upon the manhood of any nation than that which the eternal laws of nature visited upon those men in those homes in which the helpless bondwoman was made the victim of her master\u2019s base desire.140 While Willard continued to claim that Black men posed a sexual threat to white women and girls, she attempted to soften her claims with the acknowledgment that white men also posed a threat to Black women and girls. But, as Mattingly observes, Willard\u2019s condemnation of white men was \u201csituated primarily in the past and associated with the evils of slavery.\u201d141 In effect, Willard was saying that white men may have once posed a threat to Black women and girls, but now it is only Black men who are still dangerous. In response to building pressure, including the condemnation of the WCTU by other prominent Black social justice organizers, the WCTU passed a resolution against lynching in 1895. The resolution stated defensively that the WCTU \u201cought never to have been placed in the position of having to defend themselves from the charge that they favored the lynching of any human being, anywhere, under any circumstances.\u201d142 It also claimed that people \u201cmisrepresented our position,\u201d likely referring to Wells, Ransom, and others who demanded that the WCTU actively and publicly condemn lynching. Coming across this story from about 120 years ago, we recognize the still all-too-familiar pattern within social justice work\n\nChapman, Chris; Withers, A.J.. A Violent History of Benevolence: Interlocking Oppression in the Moral Economies of Social Working (pp. 096-101). University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division. Edi\u00e7\u00e3o do Kindle. and beyond. Rather than deeply reflecting on her position, this white person in a leadership position, and the organization under her direction, dug in their heels and refused to acknowledge the harm they\u2019d caused. The white people thus claimed their own innocence143 and, worse still, depicted themselves as wronged for having been accused of racism. The implication is that the Black community organizers who challenged the organization\u2019s position were overreacting, too sensitive, and too angry \u2013 all of which reaffirms white supremacist anti-Black stereotypes. For this reason, these stories of Wells, Willard, and Addams are not only important as history but also as examples of how people today who claim to be allies need to be reflexive and of when they should defer to the lead of those most directly affected by an issue. Our aim here, with respect to Addams and Willard, is to paint a more complex picture of them \u2013 particularly of Addams. We\u2019re all formed by discourses, practices, and moral economies of interlocking oppression. They shape what we can know, believe, and perceive. It\u2019s not that this shaping is out of the realm of our influence or that either woman is innocent. Recognizing these complexities and holding their positive anti-oppressive practice in tension with the clearly racist, classist, and otherwise oppressive things they did is useful in helping us all understand that we\u2019re complicit in oppression even when working against it. Acknowledging this complicity is a crucial part of critical or anti-oppressive practice.144 Early Black social workers were not perfect either. Like everyone else, they were flawed people with imperfect politics who sometimes did oppressive things and often held problematic views about other people. They were part of the project of social work\u2019s new and politically complicated interventions into the social world, and sometimes this project brought an increase in surveillance, assimilation, classism, cisheterosexism, and social control into Black communities. We don\u2019t want to paint a picture of any of these figures as perfect, because we can only follow in the footsteps of the types of people that we know to have existed. As Davis asks of representations of Martin Luther King, Jr: \u201cHow could you possibly measure up to someone like that?\u201d145 She stresses that the Montgomery bus boycott \u2013 widely considered the birth of the civil rights movement \u2013 was started by ordinary people just like any one of us, and she emphasizes how important it is for us to know this in order to open possibilities for considering what role we might play in fundamental social transformation. Maggie L. Walker and the Independent Order of St Luke Maggie L. Walker\u2019s record of significantly intervening into the social world begins with her participation in what is believed to be the first anti-segregation school strike by Black students in the United States in 1883. She went on to become a teacher and part-time worker at an insurance company and later was hired as the secretary for the Independent Order of St Luke in Richmond, Virginia. The order had been founded in 1867 by former slave Mary Prout in Baltimore.146 Lily Hardy Hammond, writing in 1922, describes the Order of St Luke when Walker first came on board as \u201ca little benefit society in Richmond \u2013 one of probably a dozen or two,\u201d which had around 1,000 members. These societies were commonplace in Black communities where \u201csickness [was] a catastrophe such as only the poorest people can fully comprehend.\u201d The society paid its members out of dues if a member became sick or died, \u201cthus saving the family from what is often, among the very poor, a crushing burden of debt.\u201d147 At a time when nation-states were just beginning to offer workers\u2019 compensation themselves, local collective organizations, included this one started by Prout, acted as a social safety net. Working class people, including Black people and recent immigrants, would cumulatively contribute to a fund, and the collective would then support them from that fund if they needed it.148 The gradual development of private disability, workers\u2019 compensation, and life insurance are commonly described as contributing to the development of the modern welfare state and as a key part of social work history.149 Walker worked to expand services; by 1922, there were 100,000 members with the organization across twenty-one states. Walker also started the St Luke\u2019s Herald, which provided community and organizational news, and covered topics that preoccupied social work publications of the day such as \u201chealth, thrift, morals, and education.\u201d150 The Herald also provided detailed accounts of lynchings, segregation, and racism. The order adopted political positions, including supporting universal suffrage and anti-lynching efforts. It led the Richmond streetcar boycott against segregation in 1904.151 The Independent Order of St Luke created a bank in 1903 under Walker\u2019s direction. Walker thus became the first woman president of a bank in the United States. The bank provided financing for Black people to buy homes and go to college, among other things.152 These funds would have been otherwise difficult or impossible for Black people in the South to obtain. The predominantly circulated history of the credit union is that it was spread by Desjardins to the United States in 1908.153 Credit unions began in Germany, and had begun to be established in Qu\u00e9bec by Alphonse Desjardins in 1900 to help low-income people secure credit. Walker\u2019s bank seems to have been aligned with the ethos of early collectivist credit unions. When such work is undertaken by a disadvantaged racialized group to provide services for those who couldn\u2019t otherwise access them due to racial segregation and rampant poverty, it is a significant intervention into the social world, enabling people to better navigate and mitigate capitalism\u2019s violences. In 1909, Walker wrote that she wished to \u201cturn the course of that almighty stream of dollar, and see if we can till our own barren lands, feed our own hungry, and clothe our own naked.\u201d154 Yet, this bank is not considered part of credit union history. Like many other early women social workers of her time, Walker was also involved in club work. She founded a Richmond Council of Colored Women, which did community service and fundraising.155 When given the opportunity, Walker and other community members fundraised to establish a home for young women, with help from a white philanthropist. According to Walker, \u201cThe white philanthropist \u2026 said that if we colored women would show our interest in social work among our people by raising a thousand dollars for it, he would give us the use of a large house, and if we made good, he would deed it to a board of white and colored women for colored work.\u201d156 In response to this possibility, the community raised the money, and the women established the home. Walker said that white women in Richmond \u201chad done fine community work for white people,\u201d but that, with respect to this project, \u201cthe white women don\u2019t work for us, \u2013 they work with us.\u201d157 Walker worked with whomever was necessary, doing whatever was necessary, to help the Black community of Richmond and, indeed, the whole country. However, if you check the index of any social work text that is not specifically about Black social work, it is almost guaranteed that you won\u2019t find her name there. The Social Work Profession, Social Science, and Education Through the Progressive Era, many professions were not accessible to Black people in Canada and the United States because of the racist, segregationist educational and economic systems. Francille Wilson writes that the only two professions open to Black people were \u201cteaching and preaching,\u201d158 neither of which required a degree at the time. Social work had the potential to be yet another accessible profession for Black people,159 given that it was outside the systems of governing accredited bodies and academic programs (unlike law and medicine, by this time). Decent paid jobs were frequently obtainable for Black social workers in a number of social sectors, although often in segregated agencies or departments.160 The availability of social work jobs may, in part, explain why an increasing number of Black (and white) men entered the profession, which had previously been considered women\u2019s work.161 In fact, differentiating social work from charity often mapped onto differentiating the work that men were doing from that which women had been doing previously.162 An increasing emphasis on the use of social science was present in Black social work at the time. In the late nineteenth century, W.E.B. Du Bois started doing sociological studies of Black communities that served to identify their needs and combat racist notions about them.163 Some social science emphasized the desire to take social work out of the hands of the churches,164 but social science was taken up by social gospellers as well.165 As in white social work, a belief in the importance of systematic and scientific social work was commonly held by Black social workers across the political spectrum during this period.166 Black social workers also developed social work educational programs, with the first undergraduate program beginning in 1911.167 George Haynes, co-founder of the National Urban League (discussed earlier), established the program at Fisk University and advocated that an understanding of Black history was necessary for Black people to conduct effective Black social work.168 Haynes was motivated by the desire to ensure that Black service users were served by Black workers and that Black social workers did not become a professional underclass because they had fewer academic credentials.169 The first social work graduate program at a Black educational institution was established in 1922 at Atlanta\u2019s Morehouse College,170 and several other programs were created around the same time.171 Although social work programs had previously been available in white institutions, they did not teach from a Black perspective or address needs that were considered important in Black communities. Black Social Work in Canada Black social work in Canada has a number of similarities to the US history: churches played a major role in community work, reform efforts, and charity; there was a strong tradition of neighbour-to-neighbour helping and community improvement; and women took on important organizing roles, particularly with respect to schools and anti-slavery organizing.172 However, because Black communities were so much smaller in Canada than in the United States, and because of other factors such as political economy, geography, and climate, there were important differences too. The level of formal organization that occurred in the United States was simply not present in Canadian Black communities during the Progressive Era.173 Nonetheless, Black social work and social workers made important contributions to their communities and to the emerging profession of social work. Canada had a significant Black population for a number of reasons, including its own legacy of slavery, which began in 1628 when the first African slave was brought to what is now called Canada.174 The main sources of Black immigrants to Canada were slaves who accompanied British loyalists during the American Revolution, escaped slaves from Jamaica (known as the Maroons), freemen after the War of 1812, escaped American slaves through the Underground Railroad, and free US Black people trying to avoid American racism.175 Black communities in Canada during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were largely found in Ontario (called Upper Canada, Canada West, and the Province of Canada at various times) and Nova Scotia,176 although there were also notable populations on Vancouver Island177 and in Montr\u00e9al178 and several smaller cities.179 This settlement pattern was largely a product of the proximity of these English-speaking areas to the United States. Some Black settlers also migrated to the western provinces, but the government instituted anti-Black immigration policies before their numbers could rise significantly, as we discuss in chapter 4.180 Many US regions where Black people were legally \u201cfree\u201d had Black Laws or Black Codes, which seriously restricted the freedom and ability of many Black people to settle. This legal framework was yet another reason some Black people immigrated to Canada.181 In 1850, the US government passed the Fugitive Slave Act, allowing for the arrest of any escaped slave anywhere in the United States and requiring that person\u2019s return to their former \u201cowner.\u201d182 In the years following the passage of this act, around 50,000 former slaves* immigrated to Upper Canada.183 (To provide some perspective, the population of Toronto, called York at the time, was only 100,000 in 1841.184) Settlements in Canada A number of settlements were intentionally established as communities for escaped slaves and other Black people seeking a better life outside the pervasive and institutional racism of the United States. While this organizing has not been traditionally depicted as social work, those responsible for these initiatives were clearly engaged in making individuals\u2019 lives better,\n\nChapman, Chris; Withers, A.J..

Edi\u00e7\u00e3o do Kindle. strengthening their communities, and undertaking many efforts that would later be called social work when white people did the same things for recent immigrants from Europe. It should be noted, though, that in spite of Canada\u2019s depiction as a refuge for Black people, many were surprised to find extreme racism in Canada as well.185 This hostility, as well as the difficulty of living off the land, meant that most people in the settlements had very difficult lives. A group of Black people who lived in Cincinnati organized to leave the city and travel to Canada in 1829. Cincinnati was a trading hub with the South, and white power brokers ensured that it was inhospitable to Black people.186 The city enforced the state\u2019s Black Laws, requiring, among other things, that new Black residents pay a $500 bond to ensure that they would be of good behaviour.187 In 1829, massive anti-Black race riots took place in Cincinnati. In an attempt to quell the violence and protect their families and property, about 300 Black men agreed to a government plan to voluntarily go to jail.188 This removal of adult men from the community did not quell the white attacks. However, according to Woodson, when the rioting ended, a number of the men who had surrendered themselves \u201cwere discharged on certificates of nativity, others gave bond for their support and good behavior, a few were dismissed as non-residents, a number of them were discharged by a justice of the Court of Common Pleas, and the rest were held indefinitely.\u201d189 Black men who had voluntarily agreed to be incarcerated in the hopes of staving off white violence were forced into forms of bail bonds, driven from the city, or indefinitely imprisoned. Prior to this incident, a group of local organizers had been planning to create a community in Ontario. The organizers likely chose an isolated rural area because they wanted to protect their community from white racism and aspired to achieve economic self-sufficiency.190 The numbers swelled after the riot; somewhere between 460 and 2,000 people fled to Canada. They settled in a community they called Wilberforce, near London, Ontario.191 Over the next decade, a school, stores, and farms were established. Wilberforce is depicted as a failure in the historical literature, but Nikki Taylor notes that the settlement met its original goal of independence.192 One of the reasons it was ultimately unsustainable was that the Canada Land Company, the Crown corporation that sold land to settlers, stopped selling land to Black settlers due to protests from white settlers in the region and the common white supremacist belief that Black people were not reliable enough to uphold their contracts.* In comparison to other settlements, Wilberforce was thus quite short lived. Yet, it provided an escape for many people fleeing racist violence and the Black Codes. Another settlement established near Windsor by the Refugee Home Society was founded in 1851,193 the year after the Fugitive Slave Act was passed and a mass exodus from the United States to Canada began in response. The Refugee Home Society offered a land-granting program with a systematic approach for providing assistance. Fugitive slaves were granted land (twenty-five acres, five acres of which were free). Settlers were then given nine years to pay for the remaining land, and the profits from the venture went into operating a school and continuing the organization\u2019s work, such as buying more land.194 One of the men credited with founding the Refugee Home Society is Henry Bibb. According to Fred Landon, Bibb believed that \u201cthe future of the people of color in Canada depended upon getting them settled on the land and his mind turned to the possibilities of establishing a distinctly Negro colony.\u201d195 For Bibb and the many Black people who lived in, organized, and supported Black colonies, this venture was a liberatory project. For the people who found refuge in Canada, it was also a liberatory project. Yet, while this designation is straightforwardly true, these Black people were also setting up colonies within a white settler colony. Celebrating Bibb in 1920, Landon titled his article \u201cHenry Bibb, a Colonizer.\u201d Bibb saw his chance for freedom for himself and his community as an active part of the colonial process. What was justice for his community helped sustain an injustice for another. Noticing how this one intensely oppressed group was complicit in the oppression of Indigenous people is, by no means, an attempt to undermine the horrors of slavery, including kidnapping, rape, enslavement, torture, and murder. Escaped slaves and other Black people were not wrong to flee to Canada. It was necessary for self-preservation, born of a context in which Black people had mostly come to the Americas through the brutality of the transatlantic slave trade. Bibb\u2019s colonizing can therefore be clearly distinguished from Europeans\u2019 choice to become part of the colonial project. However, it complicates things that former slaves adopted the role of settler. As Sunera Thobani describes, the colonial context of Canada (and the United States) results in any settlement and citizenship being complicit in the continued dispossession of Indigenous peoples\u2019 lands and sovereignty.196 Importantly, she notes this complicity alongside a careful study of the racism experienced by racialized immigrants in Canada, and she suggests that unless fundamental change is made at the level of what the nation is and its relationship to Indigenous communities and nations, the colonial complicity of all settlers remains an unresolvable dilemma. Mahmood says that agency lies not only in resisting social norms but also in how one inhabits norms. Whether in relation to Black women following the mores of separate spheres or escaped slaves taking up the work of colonization, clearly only so many options were available to long-denigrated peoples to enable them to survive and perform respectability. They may have reinforced oppressive mores and underlying moral economies of human value by doing what they did, but perhaps this contradiction might serve to invite us to reflect upon how each of us today uniquely inhabits oppressive mores, outside the simple framings of resistance versus complicity.197 Like many others, Bibb escaped slavery by becoming a colonizer. To complicate matters even further, the \u201cowner\u201d from whom he escaped was Indigenous.* Bibb wrote of his former slave master: \u201cHe was the most reasonable, and humane slaveholder that I have ever belonged to.\u201d He wrote that he would rather be owned by an Indigenous person than a white person.198 Yet, he was nevertheless this other man\u2019s legal property. Encouraging slave ownership was a US government tactic of assimilating Indigenous people in the South;199 it was a way Indigenous people were encouraged to inhabit \u201ccivilized\u201d mores. Certainly, some Indigenous people having owned slaves does nothing to cancel out or trump colonial injustices. Furthermore, Indigenous nations\u2019 responses to Black slavery were as diverse as the nations themselves. The Cherokee nation is said to have engaged in the most extensive Black slave ownership of all Indigenous groups: by the 1860s, the 17,000 members of the Cherokee nation owned 4,000 Black slaves.\u2020 The Seminole and Tuscarora nations, in contrast, provided safe haven for escaped slaves, resulting in many mixed relationships.200 Indigenous people had also been forced into slavery by Europeans and white settlers, starting with Columbus in 1492.201 Alan Gallay estimates that the British were involved in the slave trade of 30,000 to 50,000 Indigenous people in the United States by 1715.202 The practice of enslaving Indigenous people, however, was largely abandoned in the United States by 1720, in part because of militant resistance on the part of Indigenous nations.203 In telling Bibb\u2019s story, we hope to invite consideration of just how complex these histories are, rather than point fingers here or there. Bibb was a fugitive slave who, like so many slaves, was the son of a slave mother and a white father,204 and was likely conceived through the rape of his mother. He had been owned by a First Nations man on colonized land. Bibb escaped when his Indigenous master died, and went on to become a colonizer, purchasing land from the same British Crown that had stolen the land from Indigenous peoples across what\u2019s now called Canada and the United States. He did so to provide safe haven for other escaped slaves. Bibb was a social worker who contributed to founding an organization that helped his community secure basic freedom, education, and security. Bibb\u2019s story illustrates the intensity with which histories of slavery, colonialism, patriarchy, and social work interlock. When this social worker intervened in one political problem that was most pressing for him, he couldn\u2019t help but actively participate in another. Perhaps, in limitless variations, this complexity is the history of social work. Anti-Slavery Societies and Black Immigrant Assistance The earliest Black social work focused largely on assisting people who escaped slavery and fled to Canada, often with no money, no food, and no spare clothing. Rather than imagining this work to be exceptionally \u201cparticular\u201d to Black communities and therefore irrelevant to the subsequent development of social work more generally, we should look on it as work that helped to meet the needs of a group of people who were struggling as a result of unjust social conditions (as can be said of many social workings today and in the past). There was no state assistance for fugitive slaves (with the exception of Black people who emigrated after the War of 1812 and had assisted the British forces, who were given land).205 In response to this socially constituted need, a massive voluntary effort was undertaken to assist escaped slaves, which involved Black and white people collaborating in anti-slavery and liberation societies.206 These groups helped people find jobs, provided food and other resources, and more generally did the work that would later be called social work when undertaken in an organized way within poor white migrant communities. They also crossed national boundaries, just as later professional social work would do;207 for example, the American Anti-Slavery Society sent agents across the border to Canada to assist escaped slaves.208 These organizations fostered an ethos of mutual aid. Many of the people providing and organizing support were escaped slaves who had established themselves in Canada.209 Organizations like the Fugitives\u2019 Home and the Windsor Anti-Slavery Society were founded and run by fugitive slaves determined to assist other fugitives.210 Several were run by Black women, including the Ladies Freedman\u2019s Aid Society, the Ladies Colored Fugitive Association, and the Toronto Ladies\u2019 Association for the Relief of Destitute Colored Fugitives.211 Sharing the sensibility of what would soon be called social work, these organizations often believed that indiscriminate relief was bad and that aid should be restricted and controlled. For instance, the 1853 report of the Canada Anti-Slavery Society says: \u201cAll that able-bodied men and women require is a fair chance, friendly advice, and a little encouragement, perhaps a little assistance at first. Those who are really willing to work can procure employment in a short time after their arrival.\u201d212 While the fugitive relief effort was carried out on a massive scale, individual aid was often restricted, due to prevalent discourses of liberalism, capitalism, and scientific charity. It also bears repeating, yet again, that such relief efforts later run by white people for recent immigrants from Europe is called the origin of social work. Social Services A number of social work and social service projects were organized by members of Black communities in order to assist others in their communities. While some white people were also involved in helping escaped slaves, charitable and social services were segregated in Canada. Edward Lee and Ilyan Ferrer describe \u201csystemic exclusion from white social work institutions\u201d for the Black community.213 They also argue that \u201cthe exclusionary logic of the colour line was reflective of how communities of colour were racially segregated within the Canadian urban geography and provides further explanation as to why they were unable to access the white dominant charity or social settlement movements.\u201d The community building, aid, organizing, and advocacy that Black people did (and continue to do) are very clearly within the realm of what is considered social work, even though it has not been recognized as such in social work history: Elizabeth Jackson Shadd Shreve travelled through Southern Ontario forests to visit sick people and deliver food and clothing to those without;214 and Black people created youth groups, housing cooperatives, and political organizations like the Nova Scotia Association for the Advancement of Coloured People and the National Black Coalition in Nova Scotia.215 Benevolence clubs were also an important site of social service delivery and community building. One of the most prominent was called the True Band Society, which organized to create Black community self-sufficiency.216 The first True Band was founded in Amherstburg, Ontario (near Windsor), in 1854.217 Like the Provincial Union Association founded the same year, it worked to create and support Black community self-sufficiency.218 The True Bands provided resources to poor Black families, provided care for sick people, supported schools, and worked to resolve conflicts among community members.219 By 1856, there were",

Here we focus primarily on \u201cthe color-line,\u201d a phrase made famous by Black activist-scholar W.E.B Du Bois at the same time as the term \u201csocial work\u201d was coined.1 We focus on the work the colour line continues to do since his time in its framing of the Progressive Era. We reflect upon who gets credited for making history and how this choice maps onto moral economies that separate who is and isn\u2019t a valued human with something to offer our social world. In contrast to the histories most circulated, at the time the term \u201csocial work\u201d was coined, community initiatives and innovations in working with disadvantaged groups as well as efforts to transform political structures were taking place all over the world. Many of the people involved in these diverse interventions into the social world were neither Christian nor secular, and many weren\u2019t white. For example, according to Saba Mahmood, Zaynab al-Ghazali \u201cis credited with establishing a women\u2019s organization [in Egypt] called the Society of Muslim Ladies \u2026 which was initially dedicated to providing charitable services to poor women and children\u201d and later expanded to work towards structural change in collaboration with the Muslim Brotherhood.2 The Society of Muslim Ladies was established in the 1930s, and it might be imagined that al-Ghazali\u2019s efforts were made possible due to feminist successes in Europe and white settler colonies like Canada and the United States. However, Mahmood shows that al-Ghazali\u2019s interventions into the social world were \u201ca product of the sociopolitical ethos of her times and the new possibilities that were opening up for women at the turn of the twentieth century [in Egypt itself]. Al-Ghazali reached adulthood when there had already been almost three decades of women\u2019s activism in Egypt.\u201d3 There was also a proliferation of women\u2019s publications around 1900 that \u201cwas accompanied by an efflorescence of women\u2019s charitable associations, which served as the springboard for women\u2019s entry into public and political life.\u201d4 This Egyptian timeline is concurrent to, and squarely resonant with, first wave feminism in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom, as well as the rise of women\u2019s central role in providing charity that accompanied feminist movements in the Global North. In Europe and white settler colonies, histories of feminism and social work tend to be mapped onto stories of progress, which are framed as a movement away from religion and towards secularism (whether or not that fits with historical figures\u2019 understandings). Indeed, as Sherene Razack observes, \u201cthe secular/religious divide . . . functions as a color line, marking the difference between the modern, enlightened West, and people of color, notably Muslims.\u201d5 This blueprint for historical progress doesn\u2019t map well onto developments in Egypt \u2013 and not because secularism was unavailable as an option. \u201cZaynab al-Ghazali\u2019s first exposure to women\u2019s activism came at the age of sixteen when she joined the Egyptian Feminist Union (EFU), an affiliation that she reportedly later terminated because of the EFU\u2019s \u2018secular orientation.\u2019\u201d6 In reading about al-Ghazali\u2019s treatment of gender relations, it may be easy for many white readers to imagine that secular feminism is a better path towards justice. For example, \u201cthe language of \u2018women\u2019s rights\u2019 finds an important \u2026 place in al-Ghazali\u2019s speeches and writings and is often invoked to emphasize that Muslim women and men are equally called upon to serve God,\u201d7 a priority that may seem misaligned to a secular reader. However, Mahmood demonstrates the profound changes that al-Ghazali and Islamic women\u2019s movements have had on gender relations in Egypt. In her conclusion, she challenges readers with the spectre of genocide, which she suggests is implicit in secular framings of non-secular ways of being: she invites her readers to consider \u201cthat analysis as a mode of conversation [across difference], rather than mastery, can yield a vision of coexistence that does not require making other lifeworlds extinct or provisional.\u201d8 Is it possible for secular white readers in the Global North to imagine that Muslim Egyptian navigations of gender relations are just as legitimate and potentially transformative as those that are valued within secular feminism? Furthermore, what would it mean to take seriously Mahmood\u2019s challenge that we tend to approach difference as something we implicitly aim to make \u201cextinct?\u201d Histories like al-Ghazali\u2019s are left out of the standard account of social work, which traces white US settlement houses and Charity Organization Society initiatives back to white people\u2019s initiatives in the United Kingdom.9 This chapter offers a small corrective to this tendency. We do not, however, claim to offer a complete account of the story of racialized peoples\u2019 contributions to what has come to be called social work. There will always be examples left out, and our account is no exception. However, by foregrounding and naming these exclusions, and by making humble correctives to a few such exclusions, we hope to offer a context for thinking further about the kinds of interventions into the social world that are normally left out of social work history. We aim to show that these exclusions are arbitrary, in the sense of being unjustifiable; yet, at the same time, they are logically coherent within the framework of white supremacy and have real effects on people\u2019s lives and possibilities. They are arbitrary because there is no objective reason to privilege white people\u2019s accomplishments and to leave out those of racialized communities; but they are perfectly sensible and coherent within the moral economy of white supremacy. White supremacy shapes both the inclusions and the exclusions of the standard account of social work\u2019s origin. In response to these exclusions, this chapter highlights some innovations, contributions, and legacies that racialized communities have made, focusing on Black communities in the United States and Canada. The standard account of social work is simply a white account of white social work.* It ignores racialized peoples\u2019 contributions to the mishmash of interventions into our social world that has been called social work for over a century, and thus constructs social work as white in both the past and the present. The few historical figures we name, alongside countless Black anti-slavery and anti-lynching advocates, community organizers, settlement workers, and other activists and charity workers, were active in forging the foundation of modern social work. Yet, it\u2019s only recently that early Black social workers like Ida B. Wells, Mary Ann Shadd Cary, Mary Church Terrell, Reverdy Ransom, and Maggie Walker are having their histories told or read in contexts where there aren\u2019t exclusively Black students, and where these historical figures are understood to be the originators of social work (as opposed to only the originators of Black social work) that they really were. If we understand social work to include various forms of relief initiatives, as well as diverse actions aiming towards community and large-scale political and social transformation \u2013 as with the range of work done at Hull-House or by al-Ghazali and the Society of Muslim Ladies \u2013 then the distinction between what does and does not get officially designated as social work becomes increasingly arbitrary and unjustifiable. As Linda Gordon asserts, \u201cWelfare histories [have] been by definition white-centered.\u201d10 She shows that it\u2019s \u201cpossible to make the widespread welfare reform activity of minority women visible only by changing the definition of the topic and its periodization.\u201d11 Likewise, such a move shifts the understanding of the entirety of social work history. Because social workers are assumed to be white, social work within communities of colour \u2013 including that which inspired later white social workers \u2013 gets almost entirely left out. Before recounting the histories themselves, we might reflect: considering the explicit anti-Black racism and violence that was widespread in Canada and the United States at the time of social work\u2019s nominal emergence, what kinds of efforts would have made sense for Black social workers? This chapter highlights a few stories of people who were engaged in certain kinds of social welfare activity that have not been officially acknowledged as such within histories of social welfare. Histories such as these are frequently dismissed as particular to specific populations. When white people worked with other white people, the particularity wasn\u2019t noted \u2013 whiteness as particularity went unremarked. But Black social work, when discussed at all, tends to be told as Black history rather than part of a collective history. White history is told as a shared history, whereas Black, Indigenous, and racialized histories are normally deemed relevant only to their respective communities. But, considering the social and political context, it made sense for Black social workers to focus on interventions relating specifically to Black communities.* The reasons for this focus include racism, a sense of connection to those communities, a feeling of solidarity with the struggles their own neighbours were experiencing, and the recognition that their neighbours were struggling distinctly, and often more intensely, than white people living nearby (due to racial segregation and the uneven distribution of resources that has always accompanied it in practice12). Black social work was no more particular or insular than work being done within white communities. Yet Black social work, and its contributions to the world we live in, continues to be largely unacknowledged by white recorders of history, which of course includes white recorders of social work history. When white social work was first emerging, a strong and diverse tradition of Black social work was also emerging. Jane Addams is championed as the founder of radical social work, and her anti-racism is used as a prime example of how she lived her political commitments. At the same time (and earlier), however, there were massive organizing efforts on the part of Black people who were pivotal in founding radical social work. If we relieve Addams of some of the responsibility for carrying the entire tradition of social justice\u2013oriented social work practice, we can look to other historical figures and social work movements to see that alternative approaches to helping have always existed \u2013 including among professional social workers. Iris Carlton-LaNey points out that when social work was laying down its roots in white America, Black people were developing a \u201cparallel social welfare system.\u201d13 Because of racist segregation policies, many Black people could not access white social welfare programs, and Black service providers were not welcome in the majority of white organizations. In this context, Black communities\u2019 efforts focused on what at the time was referred to as \u201cracial uplift,\u201d and a number of originators of Black social work believed that Black people should deliver services for Black people. Ida B. Wells, for instance, wrote: \u201cThe Afro-American can do for himself what no one else can do for him.\u201d14 Black communities organized benefit programs, schools, adult education initiatives, community centres, healthcare clinics, homeless shelters, settlement houses, seniors\u2019 homes, youth programs, parenting education, daycares, kindergartens, recreation programs, job banks, clothing banks, ice banks, food banks, and bank banks. And yet, white people providing these types of services to white people at this time is what is called the origin of social work. Therefore, we can ask: Who gets to tell history? Who are its imagined and actual audiences? Who gets cast as the protagonists or primary characters in the stories that are told, and how does this choice affect the take-up of these stories among diverse audiences? Who benefits from these histories being told in the ways that they\u2019re told? And what role do these versions of history have in furthering the moral economies that continue to accumulate moral worth for white subjects and denigrate the imagined value of people of colour? Black Churches: Bestowing Charity and Organizing for Change There are limitless forms by which people help one another. However, resonating with Egyptian developments at this time, two of the key sites in which help became organized and formalized in Black communities were churches (especially those associated with the social gospel movement) and women\u2019s clubs (which were either secular or attached to a religious institution). The church therefore played a key role in the development of Black social work. In white social work, \u201csocial work tended to fill spaces left by the reduced role of religion in everyday life,\u201d15 but organized religion played a more central role in Black social work. This situation arose not only because of the role that organized religion played in the development of charity and aid, which also heavily influenced white social work, but also for reasons particular to Black communities. In many Black communities, churches were the only available community spaces. In many places in the United States, it was illegal for Black people to congregate in groups of more than\n\nChapman, Chris; Withers, A.J..

Edi\u00e7\u00e3o do Kindle. five people other than at church, which meant that organizing was criminalized outside of the church. According to Carter G. Woodson, a prominent Black intellectual at the time, churches were \u201cthe only institution in which [Black people could] freely exercise authority\u201d16 and pursue strategies of self-determination and self-governance.* As a result of these factors, churches were important spaces for community organizing, and they ran numerous social and political programs alongside their more traditional role of providing relief to poor people.17 Some Black people, however, were critical of the role of organized religion. W.E.B. Du Bois, for example, disparaged Black churches for not doing enough to help Black communities. In 1912, he wrote in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) publication The Crisis that the church was \u201cstill building churches when people need homes and schools, and persisting in crucifying critics rather than realizing the handwriting on the wall.\u201d18 At the same time, he recognized the importance of churches and their centrality in Black communities.19 In the conclusion to an extensive study he led on the Black church, Du Bois, with Mary Church Tyrell and Kelly Miller, recognized the significance of the church as \u201ca mighty social power,\u201d but also asserted \u201cit needs cleansing; reviving and inspiring.\u201d20 One of the key influences of social work and the helping professions in Canada and the United States was the social gospel movement.21 Social gospel originated as a reaction to the social and economic devastation that industrial capitalism caused and the absence of an appropriate response from conventional Christianity.22 Made up of radical and progressive Protestants, the movement engaged in a variety of social welfare programs. Many social change\u2013oriented churches throughout the United States implemented important social programs.23 The Institutional Church in Chicago, under the leadership of Black Reverend Reverdy C. Ransom, is one example of the social gospel movement in action. Ransom and his congregation built a settlement house that opened in 1900 and was designed to cater to the needs of the Black community.24 Ransom was a radical, encouraging people to think about adopting socialism, which he saw as a solution to racism.25 He also worked to help settle conflicts between white strikers and Black strikebreakers in Chicago.26 Resonantly, Woodson describes how a Congregational church in Massachusetts under the leadership of W.N. DeBerry established \u201ca free employment bureau, a women\u2019s welfare league, a night school of domestic training, a girls\u2019 and a boys\u2019 club emphasizing the handicrafts, music, and athletics.\u201d27 Similar programs existed in progressive Black churches across the United States and Canada.28 The social gospel movement worked in both white and Black communities to deal with the material crises that people experienced. In addition to increasing people\u2019s access to education, childcare, settlement houses, homeless shelters, and other social services,29 the social gospel movement also worked towards large-scale political change.* Carter G. Woodson, known as the \u201cFather of Black History,\u201d30 referred to the work of social gospellers as \u201csocial work\u201d in The History of the Negro Church in 1921. \u201cSeparate Spheres\u201d and Women\u2019s Clubs Following the social disruptions caused in Europe and white settler spaces by capitalist industrialization and urbanization, a new discourse of gendered mores, norms, and values emerged. This new arrangement, referred to as \u201cseparate spheres,\u201d was a system which held that respectable men and women should only occupy roles then considered gender appropriate. The resultant separation between men and women was helpful in creating possibilities for love-based companionships among ruling class women at the time, known as \u201cBoston marriages\u201d (which we discuss in the next chapter).31 It was oppressive in many other ways, however, and it furthered the moral economy of differentiated human value \u2013 valuing the supposedly men\u2019s sphere over the women\u2019s sphere. According to separate spheres discourse and mores, the public domain (politics, paid work, and so on) was to be peopled exclusively by men, and the private domain (household and family) was to be exclusively women\u2019s domain.32 These supposedly \u201ctraditional\u201d ideas have a much more recent history than we tend to think. Previously in Europe, although gender roles were segregated, local community norms and immediate family needs largely governed how, where, and with whom people spent their time. The home had often been the location of economic activity, whether for farming or cottage industries, and men and women, boys and girls would often work alongside one another on many day-to-day tasks. The notion that men should work for pay and women should tend to the home and care for the family was at best inconsistently followed, and there was no sense that it was morally superior to always segregate genders. In response to the moral panic arising due to the increased personal freedom that resulted from capitalist industrialization and urbanization, separate spheres discourse arose to police interactions between men and women. It was essentially a moral discourse. In order to demonstrate oneself as respectable, a person would only ever labour in ways then considered gender appropriate. Alongside shifting the norms and mores within ruling class culture itself, this change enabled yet another way for poor and racialized people, especially women, to be looked down upon as morally inferior: female slaves and poor women of any race could not abstain from the \u201cpublic\u201d or \u201cmen\u2019s sphere\u201d of labouring for others. Poor women worked outside of their homes to survive,33 and, obviously, slaves could not freely choose how to direct their labour. Thus, ruling class women\u2019s respectability and morality increasingly relied upon differentiating themselves from women who cooked, cleaned, and provided care in other people\u2019s homes and were considered inferior for doing so.34 Relatively well-off Black women, before and after emancipation, often demonstrated their respectability and full humanity by adhering to the dominant social mores of separate spheres. Black communities frequently adopted all or part of separate spheres norms and discourse. Of Black Nova Scotians, for example, Suzanne Morton writes: \u201cGender ideology that placed women in the home offered protection and dignity within their own community, even if it could not secure recognition from the white middle class.\u201d35 Harley explains the adherence to separate spheres norms in the context of the post-emancipation US South: \u201cGender-defined work and domestic responsibilities were symbolic of their new status.\u201d He argues that, within a white supremacist and patriarchal society, \u201csex-segregation helped to protect black women, married or single, from charges of immorality such as those made by nineteenth- and twentieth-century writers and reformers.\u201d36 The performance of separate spheres allowed select Black people to establish membership in the new middle class, which Marie Louise Fellows and Sherene Razack describe as gaining \u201ca toehold on respectability.\u201d37 Although white supremacy and patriarchy continued to shape and define their lives and possibilities, some Black women were able to accumulate the social markers of the bourgeois class (certain kinds of dress and education, avoiding labour considered unbecoming for a lady, and so on) through which they precariously entered the ranks of the middle class. As in white communities, separate spheres mores intersected with the rise of the middle class professions, which shaped selective opportunities for women to enter the public sphere \u2013 but only in roles related to the direction and surveillance of the private sphere. Women occupied paid positions in nursing, childhood education, and social welfare activities, but only rarely in more squarely male-gendered professions such as law or medicine. In Black communities, the transition to women occupying leadership roles within the female-gendered spheres seems to have been smoother than in white communities. For instance, Shirley Yee writes: \u201cBlack women often worked with Black men in building institutions that were critical to daily life. Black women\u2019s involvement in the establishment of churches, schools, and mutual aid societies reflected a long legacy of cooperation between Black men and women.\u201d She shows how \u201cBlack Canadian women continually blurred the line between public and private and tailored their own notions of \u2018true\u2019 womanhood to the realities they faced in daily life.\u201d38 In both Canada and the United States, according to Yee, \u201cthe adoption of patriarchal structures that ironically symbolized freedom also illustrated the pervasiveness of sex role ideology.\u201d However, this ideology was resisted too \u2013 or at least it was navigated in ways that seem to have been unique to Black communities: \u201cThrough their public activism, Black women maintained the interconnectedness of family and community, the private and the public \u2013 between which there was little distinction\u201d in their real lives.39 Their ability to interconnect may have been because Black women had always worked in the \u201cpublic sphere,\u201d and these social mores were only newly available to them; and it may have also reflected distinct (and surely internally diverse) gender mores and norms that had been brought over from West Africa and were preserved through slavery.40 During this time, women\u2019s clubs were one public forum for women to engage in the social governance of the private realm, discussing and acting on issues that were deemed gender-role appropriate. The 1890s saw a wave of clubs emerge in the United States that were focused not only on the home, but also on social and political reform.41 In this decade alone, clubs emerged in New York, Boston, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Jefferson City, Omaha, New Orleans, Knoxville, and Providence \u2013 and likely in smaller communities as well.42 In 1896, the National Association of Colored Women was founded by activists including Ida B. Wells-Barnett, Mary Church Terrell, Francis Harper, and Harriet Tubman, bringing Black women\u2019s clubs from across the country into a coalition.43 Women\u2019s clubs of this era were largely focused on individual and community betterment, which they called racial uplift.44 Clubs also served as a training ground for women to obtain community work and social service skills.45 With some important exceptions, these clubs were run by middle and upper class Black women, who could follow separate spheres mores for women46 and often had a college education.47 Women\u2019s clubs typically espoused domestic feminism, which, according to Nancy Cott, is \u201cwomen\u2019s assertion of private power (particularly reproductive control) within their families.\u201d48 Club women, according to Anne Meis Knupfer, \u201cperceived their roles of mother, wife, and homemaker as cornerstones to \u2018race uplift\u2019 and progress.\u201d49 They founded orphanages, settlement houses, youth clubs, kindergartens, women\u2019s education opportunities, employment services, youth/recreational programs, nursing homes, daycares, and at least one YWCA.50 Notably, these programs were all in keeping with the ideologies of domestic feminism and separate spheres. Club women helped establish many important social services and worked towards strengthening the Black community, always in keeping with those arenas of life in which it was normatively deemed appropriate for women to participate. The social and political effects of the work of Black women\u2019s clubs, like the concrete effects of Addams\u2019s and Richmond\u2019s work, were therefore complicated. They provided crucial programs and resources to communities that were usually excluded from white social work services, but they also acted to police morality and gender roles. Women\u2019s clubs worked towards reform and progress, but they also confined social service providers and recipients alike to gender roles deemed appropriate according to classed and racialized social mores.* The Great Migration: Migrant Assistance and the Shift towards Black Incarceration The \u201cGreat Migration\u201d began around 1915 and, according to Isabel Wilkerson, was \u201ca statistically measurable demographic phenomenon marked by unabated outflows of black \u00e9migr\u00e9s\u201d to Northern US states.51 In order to support the many people who were arriving in cities in the North, often incredibly poor and in need of assistance, Black people set up a number of welfare programs.52 One of the key areas of assistance was with women from the South, many of whom were targeted by predatory employment agencies that would force them into debt and, at times, horrendous working conditions. Black (and sometimes white) social workers were sent out to assist with directions, funds, a place to stay, and advocacy.53 The largest organization working with Black migrants from the South in this period was the National Urban League (NUL).54 Black social worker and social work educator George Haynes founded and led the NUL, which Elmer Martin and Joanne Mitchell Martin say had the \u201cleading, most advanced black social workers.\u201d55 The NUL monitored existing relief programs, advocating for Black people who had been treated unjustly.56 They worked to ensure economic access to Black people, which involved combatting racism and difficult social and material conditions,",

It should be noted, though, that in spite of Canada\u2019s depiction as a refuge for Black people, many were surprised to find extreme racism in Canada as well.185 This hostility, as well as the difficulty of living off the land, meant that most people in the settlements had very difficult lives. A group of Black people who lived in Cincinnati organized to leave the city and travel to Canada in 1829. Cincinnati was a trading hub with the South, and white power brokers ensured that it was inhospitable to Black people.186 The city enforced the state\u2019s Black Laws, requiring, among other things, that new Black residents pay a $500 bond to ensure that they would be of good behaviour.187 In 1829, massive anti-Black race riots took place in Cincinnati. In an attempt to quell the violence and protect their families and property, about 300 Black men agreed to a government plan to voluntarily go to jail.188 This removal of adult men from the community did not quell the white attacks. However, according to Woodson, when the rioting ended, a number of the men who had surrendered themselves \u201cwere discharged on certificates of nativity, others gave bond for their support and good behavior, a few were dismissed as non-residents, a number of them were discharged by a justice of the Court of Common Pleas, and the rest were held indefinitely.\u201d189 Black men who had voluntarily agreed to be incarcerated in the hopes of staving off white violence were forced into forms of bail bonds, driven from the city, or indefinitely imprisoned. Prior to this incident, a group of local organizers had been planning to create a community in Ontario. The organizers likely chose an isolated rural area because they wanted to protect their community from white racism and aspired to achieve economic self-sufficiency.190 The numbers swelled after the riot; somewhere between 460 and 2,000 people fled to Canada. They settled in a community they called Wilberforce, near London, Ontario.191 Over the next decade, a school, stores, and farms were established. Wilberforce is depicted as a failure in the historical literature, but Nikki Taylor notes that the settlement met its original goal of independence.192 One of the reasons it was ultimately unsustainable was that the Canada Land Company, the Crown corporation that sold land to settlers, stopped selling land to Black settlers due to protests from white settlers in the region and the common white supremacist belief that Black people were not reliable enough to uphold their contracts.* In comparison to other settlements, Wilberforce was thus quite short lived. Yet, it provided an escape for many people fleeing racist violence and the Black Codes. Another settlement established near Windsor by the Refugee Home Society was founded in 1851,193 the year after the Fugitive Slave Act was passed and a mass exodus from the United States to Canada began in response. The Refugee Home Society offered a land-granting program with a systematic approach for providing assistance. Fugitive slaves were granted land (twenty-five acres, five acres of which were free). Settlers were then given nine years to pay for the remaining land, and the profits from the venture went into operating a school and continuing the organization\u2019s work, such as buying more land.194 One of the men credited with founding the Refugee Home Society is Henry Bibb. According to Fred Landon, Bibb believed that \u201cthe future of the people of color in Canada depended upon getting them settled on the land and his mind turned to the possibilities of establishing a distinctly Negro colony.\u201d195 For Bibb and the many Black people who lived in, organized, and supported Black colonies, this venture was a liberatory project. For the people who found refuge in Canada, it was also a liberatory project. Yet, while this designation is straightforwardly true, these Black people were also setting up colonies within a white settler colony. Celebrating Bibb in 1920, Landon titled his article \u201cHenry Bibb, a Colonizer.\u201d Bibb saw his chance for freedom for himself and his community as an active part of the colonial process. What was justice for his community helped sustain an injustice for another. Noticing how this one intensely oppressed group was complicit in the oppression of Indigenous people is, by no means, an attempt to undermine the horrors of slavery, including kidnapping, rape, enslavement, torture, and murder. Escaped slaves and other Black people were not wrong to flee to Canada. It was necessary for self-preservation, born of a context in which Black people had mostly come to the Americas through the brutality of the transatlantic slave trade. Bibb\u2019s colonizing can therefore be clearly distinguished from Europeans\u2019 choice to become part of the colonial project. However, it complicates things that former slaves adopted the role of settler. As Sunera Thobani describes, the colonial context of Canada (and the United States) results in any settlement and citizenship being complicit in the continued dispossession of Indigenous peoples\u2019 lands and sovereignty.196 Importantly, she notes this complicity alongside a careful study of the racism experienced by racialized immigrants in Canada, and she suggests that unless fundamental change is made at the level of what the nation is and its relationship to Indigenous communities and nations, the colonial complicity of all settlers remains an unresolvable dilemma. Mahmood says that agency lies not only in resisting social norms but also in how one inhabits norms. Whether in relation to Black women following the mores of separate spheres or escaped slaves taking up the work of colonization, clearly only so many options were available to long-denigrated peoples to enable them to survive and perform respectability. They may have reinforced oppressive mores and underlying moral economies of human value by doing what they did, but perhaps this contradiction might serve to invite us to reflect upon how each of us today uniquely inhabits oppressive mores, outside the simple framings of resistance versus complicity.197 Like many others, Bibb escaped slavery by becoming a colonizer. To complicate matters even further, the \u201cowner\u201d from whom he escaped was Indigenous.* Bibb wrote of his former slave master: \u201cHe was the most reasonable, and humane slaveholder that I have ever belonged to.\u201d He wrote that he would rather be owned by an Indigenous person than a white person.198 Yet, he was nevertheless this other man\u2019s legal property. Encouraging slave ownership was a US government tactic of assimilating Indigenous people in the South;199 it was a way Indigenous people were encouraged to inhabit \u201ccivilized\u201d mores. Certainly, some Indigenous people having owned slaves does nothing to cancel out or trump colonial injustices. Furthermore, Indigenous nations\u2019 responses to Black slavery were as diverse as the nations themselves. The Cherokee nation is said to have engaged in the most extensive Black slave ownership of all Indigenous groups: by the 1860s, the 17,000 members of the Cherokee nation owned 4,000 Black slaves.\u2020 The Seminole and Tuscarora nations, in contrast, provided safe haven for escaped slaves, resulting in many mixed relationships.200 Indigenous people had also been forced into slavery by Europeans and white settlers, starting with Columbus in 1492.201 Alan Gallay estimates that the British were involved in the slave trade of 30,000 to 50,000 Indigenous people in the United States by 1715.202 The practice of enslaving Indigenous people, however, was largely abandoned in the United States by 1720, in part because of militant resistance on the part of Indigenous nations.203 In telling Bibb\u2019s story, we hope to invite consideration of just how complex these histories are, rather than point fingers here or there. Bibb was a fugitive slave who, like so many slaves, was the son of a slave mother and a white father,204 and was likely conceived through the rape of his mother. He had been owned by a First Nations man on colonized land. Bibb escaped when his Indigenous master died, and went on to become a colonizer, purchasing land from the same British Crown that had stolen the land from Indigenous peoples across what\u2019s now called Canada and the United States. He did so to provide safe haven for other escaped slaves. Bibb was a social worker who contributed to founding an organization that helped his community secure basic freedom, education, and security. Bibb\u2019s story illustrates the intensity with which histories of slavery, colonialism, patriarchy, and social work interlock. When this social worker intervened in one political problem that was most pressing for him, he couldn\u2019t help but actively participate in another. Perhaps, in limitless variations, this complexity is the history of social work. Anti-Slavery Societies and Black Immigrant Assistance The earliest Black social work focused largely on assisting people who escaped slavery and fled to Canada, often with no money, no food, and no spare clothing. Rather than imagining this work to be exceptionally \u201cparticular\u201d to Black communities and therefore irrelevant to the subsequent development of social work more generally, we should look on it as work that helped to meet the needs of a group of people who were struggling as a result of unjust social conditions (as can be said of many social workings today and in the past). There was no state assistance for fugitive slaves (with the exception of Black people who emigrated after the War of 1812 and had assisted the British forces, who were given land).205 In response to this socially constituted need, a massive voluntary effort was undertaken to assist escaped slaves, which involved Black and white people collaborating in anti-slavery and liberation societies.206 These groups helped people find jobs, provided food and other resources, and more generally did the work that would later be called social work when undertaken in an organized way within poor white migrant communities. They also crossed national boundaries, just as later professional social work would do;207 for example, the American Anti-Slavery Society sent agents across the border to Canada to assist escaped slaves.208 These organizations fostered an ethos of mutual aid. Many of the people providing and organizing support were escaped slaves who had established themselves in Canada.209 Organizations like the Fugitives\u2019 Home and the Windsor Anti-Slavery Society were founded and run by fugitive slaves determined to assist other fugitives.210 Several were run by Black women, including the Ladies Freedman\u2019s Aid Society, the Ladies Colored Fugitive Association, and the Toronto Ladies\u2019 Association for the Relief of Destitute Colored Fugitives.211 Sharing the sensibility of what would soon be called social work, these organizations often believed that indiscriminate relief was bad and that aid should be restricted and controlled. For instance, the 1853 report of the Canada Anti-Slavery Society says: \u201cAll that able-bodied men and women require is a fair chance, friendly advice, and a little encouragement, perhaps a little assistance at first. Those who are really willing to work can procure employment in a short time after their arrival.\u201d212 While the fugitive relief effort was carried out on a massive scale, individual aid was often restricted, due to prevalent discourses of liberalism, capitalism, and scientific charity. It also bears repeating, yet again, that such relief efforts later run by white people for recent immigrants from Europe is called the origin of social work. Social Services A number of social work and social service projects were organized by members of Black communities in order to assist others in their communities. While some white people were also involved in helping escaped slaves, charitable and social services were segregated in Canada. Edward Lee and Ilyan Ferrer describe \u201csystemic exclusion from white social work institutions\u201d for the Black community.213 They also argue that \u201cthe exclusionary logic of the colour line was reflective of how communities of colour were racially segregated within the Canadian urban geography and provides further explanation as to why they were unable to access the white dominant charity or social settlement movements.\u201d The community building, aid, organizing, and advocacy that Black people did (and continue to do) are very clearly within the realm of what is considered social work, even though it has not been recognized as such in social work history: Elizabeth Jackson Shadd Shreve travelled through Southern Ontario forests to visit sick people and deliver food and clothing to those without;214 and Black people created youth groups, housing cooperatives, and political organizations like the Nova Scotia Association for the Advancement of Coloured People and the National Black Coalition in Nova Scotia.215 Benevolence clubs were also an important site of social service delivery and community building. One of the most prominent was called the True Band Society, which organized to create Black community self-sufficiency.216 The first True Band was founded in Amherstburg, Ontario (near Windsor), in 1854.217 Like the Provincial Union Association founded the same year, it worked to create and support Black community self-sufficiency.218 The True Bands provided resources to poor Black families, provided care for sick people, supported schools, and worked to resolve conflicts among community members.219 By 1856, there were\n\nChapman, Chris; Withers, A.J..

They considered the raising of funds and supplies from white people to be shameful, and they wanted Black communities to be self-sufficient. They also opposed the construction of Black settlements, calling for people to integrate into Canadian society. One of the strongest voices against collecting resources (\u201cbegging,\u201d as they called it) was Mary Ann Shadd Cary, who was active in Black community social services and media.221 Black communities also built formal institutions modelled after those imported from Europe through colonialism.222 For example, Nova Scotian orphanages and children\u2019s homes wouldn\u2019t admit Black children \u2013 resulting in them sometimes being put in asylums or on work farms.223 Therefore, under the leadership of James R. Johnston and the African United Baptists Association, the Nova Scotia Home for Coloured Children (NSHCC) opened in 1921.224 Due to systemic racial segregation in social services,225 this institution was incredibly important to the Black community. Its opening marked the largest gathering of Black people in Nova Scotia since 1783.226 The NSHCC is an example of the social work initiatives that Black communities undertook in Canada. Candice Roker discusses the \u201cpositive survival\u201d resistance to racist exclusion of Black people in Nova Scotia. She argues that the creation of the NSHCC \u201cis one of the most public examples of the African Nova Scotian community taking care of its own.\u201d227 The NSHCC retained its historical name but became racially integrated in the 1970s;228 it continued to operate as an orphanage until the late 1980s.229 Like so many institutions that house vulnerable children, including Indian residential schools and many institutions for disabled children,230 significant abuses took place at the NSHCC. In 1948, a social worker documented concerns about inadequate food for the children living in the NSHCC. Sexual abuse was documented in the 1980s, including the rape of a child, but no charges were ever laid.231 In 2001, a number of former residents of the home filed lawsuits for abuse,232 some of which dates back to as early as the 1940s.233 In 2014, the premier of Nova Scotia apologized for the abuse as part of a settlement with survivors, and a restorative inquiry was announced in 2015.234 Terrible things happened at this institution that should never happen to anyone. It is entirely possible abuse was present there from its early days. Yet, even then, we can hold this injustice in tension with an acknowledgment of the importance of what the Nova Scotian Black community did by building the home. Building a racially segregated institution, which seems to have been characterized by the same abuses of power as were found at other institutional sites, can be conceptualized as yet another instance of navigating the norms that were available at the time. Black Nova Scotians built for their community\u2019s children a resource often considered at that time indispensable for serving children in need. As in so many other institutions, many children were seriously harmed within its walls. There is frequently a tendency to view historical developments as either good or bad, but removing the NSHCC from \u201cgood\u201d anti-racist history and placing it into \u201cbad\u201d institutional history prevents us from struggling to cultivate a complex relationship with this fundamentally interlocking history and its legacies. Black communities navigated available norms, but didn\u2019t adopt all available norms. As a glaring example with tremendous relevance to contemporary social work, we found no historical record of any Black community in the United States or Canada establishing a child protection agency in which people from outside a family or community scrutinized parents and determined whether a child would be allowed to remain with them. In the extensive social welfare systems created by Black folks in Canada and the United States, we found no evidence of a single Black agency that practised involuntary child apprehension. White child protection agencies didn\u2019t normally* serve Black families until the end of legal racial segregation in the mid-twentieth century. Yet, even in cities with significant Black social welfare infrastructures, including women\u2019s clubs, settlement houses, and orphanages, it seems that no Black community practised child apprehension. (If we\u2019re wrong and one or two communities did so, it would have been extremely marginal considering that we\u2019ve encountered no trace of it.) Black and white social workers learned from one another and often worked together, developing similar (usually racially segregated) services, but Black social workers didn\u2019t practice child apprehension. In the only article we found exploring the fact that professional child welfare didn\u2019t operate in US Black communities until after legal racial segregation was abolished,\u2020 Jillian Jimenez writes: \u201cA shadow child welfare system [existed] that performed similar functions to the public child welfare system from which African American children were largely excluded.\u201d235 In apparently every Black community, people were left to do the work of \u201cchild protection\u201d and \u201cchild welfare\u201d using means that had been available to them before anybody had ever become a paid \u201csocial worker.\u201d In a recent interview about having won the Woman of Distinction Award, Black Canadian politician Zanana Akande was asked where her ethic of \u201ccontinuing to push\u201d for justice originated. In her answer, she described the informal \u201csocial workers who weren\u2019t social workers\u201d who collectively raised her when she was growing up in downtown Toronto in the 1940s and \u201950s: \u201cThat [ethic] comes from where I was born and the people around me \u2013 the first social workers who weren\u2019t social workers, because we were all raised collectively by our parents and by anyone else who happened to walk down the street and see us \u2013 that you must speak out, you must take care of each other, and you must push for what you want.\u201d236 In Black communities prior to the end of racial segregation and the introduction of child protective agencies into Black communities, practices, norms, and mores were in place to protect children from violence, respond to tragedies such as parental death, and so on. \u201cChildren routinely lived with grandparents not only in the case of death, but when one or both parents left the local area to look for work \u2026 [and] children with no family would be taken in by unrelated adults in the neighbourhood who did not have children.\u201d237 Resonant practices have existed in all communities at all times, varying significantly from place to place. Jimenez traces these specific Black child welfare practices to West African traditions of extended kinship and communal care for children, as well as to strategies later developed in response to the violences of slavery \u2013 in which Black children and adults were kidnapped, forcibly separated from one another, and held as white people\u2019s property. In the first half of the twentieth century in Black communities in the United States, the principal strategy for protecting children from abuse and neglect was community surveillance: \u201cthe extended family, especially grandmothers \u2026 aunts, great aunts, and older sisters \u2026 provided a concentric circle of approval and disapproval to support or criticize the child rearing practices of a child\u2019s primary caretakers.\u201d238 There were community-sanctioned interventions for when adults harmed children, which were rooted in community-specific hierarchies of moral and political authority. Older women relatives in Black America occupied the role only then being taken over in white America by paid ruling class strangers. One practice is a violent imposition, and the other assumes communities are capable of healing and protecting themselves; both are specific and situated means of social working to keep children safe from abuse and neglect. A very different child protection system would be in place today if families and communities were imagined capable of protecting and caring for their own children, rather than assuming the state and its professionals must do so. As a consequence of racist laws and mores, Black families were fortunate to rarely have their children apprehended by state authorities during the first half of the twentieth century. Instead, they carried on and internally adapted long-standing traditions of child protection and care. The earliest white child protection agencies were born at a time of normalized extreme anti-Black violence. Black childrearing practices at the time therefore explicitly sought to prevent children from exposing themselves to the normative violences of white supremacy;239 we can imagine the devastation that might have resulted had Black families become targeted by white social work. Black families worked to protect Black children from abusive parents and also from white supremacy. Their efforts were central to Black child protection during a time of widespread lynching and other explicit anti-Black violence. Such child protection isn\u2019t normatively validated as \u201csocial work.\u201d Of all the diverse and significant Black interventions into the social world for over a century, from slavery liberation societies through to the civil rights movement of the mid-twentieth century, there seems to have been a consensus that the approach to \u201cchild protection\u201d taken for granted among white ruling classes wasn\u2019t morally or politically acceptable. No matter how one is positioned in relation to these histories, this wholesale rejection is an astounding fact for us all to seriously reflect upon today. Class Stratification and How It Interlocked with Racism and Social Work As with white social workers, Black social workers in the United States and Canada tended to be upper or middle class people assisting poor people. Class divisions among Black people, however, had different effects and significance from those among white people, given that segregation and racism had a levelling effect on Black communities. No matter how much money you had, you often could not live in a ruling class neighbourhood if you were Black, nor was it easy to get a loan, be free from the threat of racist violence, go many places, or do many other things available to white people. Class status did not inoculate against racism. Carlton-LaNey writes, \u201cThere was very little physical, social and economic distance\u201d between those doing early Black social work and others in the communities where they worked. They \u201clived in the same communities and by virtue of race shared many of the same societal problems and issues of concern.\u201d However, those \u201cwho engaged in the emerging social work profession were among the \u2026 educated elite of the African American community.\u201d240 Educated Black women primarily provided social services,241 which could have perpetuated white ruling class social mores. Yet, Carlton-LaNey asserts that \u201clower class women were also active in clubs and formed organizations in an effort to serve themselves and the needy in their communities.\u201d242 She writes that this class diversity among workers, as well as shared experiences of racism, helped these social workers more reflexively consider their own power: even educated Black social workers with \u201cproperty ownership, poise, and eloquence \u2026 [were often] treated like \u2018washerwomen\u2019 [which] \u2026 kept them attuned to the deplorable conditions to which their less-fortunate sisters were subjected.\u201d243 Through to the 1920s, \u201ca white woman in Halifax looking for help with her laundry felt free to stop any African-Nova Scotian woman on the street and request \u2018where she could get a good girl.\u2019\u201d244 White supremacy served to homogenize Blackness so that, in practice, it was the only relevant identifier in many cases, or at least it was the identity category that trumped all others. The assumption that any Black person would know where to get a cleaner in Halifax was based on the pervasive white supremacist association of Black people with domestic service and dirt. This thinking had important social significance and was intimately tied up with interlocking moral economies of human value. At this time, eugenics was often referred to as \u201cmental hygiene,\u201d245 and Ivory Soap boasted about its ability to \u201ccivilize\u201d Indigenous people.246 This period was also the era in which white ruling class women acquired an unprecedented degree of exalted bourgeois subjectivity. Fellows and Razack explain that dirt was important in constituting these select women as separate and distinct from \u2013 and to imagine themselves morally superior to \u2013 \u201cwasherwomen.\u201d247 The renegotiation of white ruling class women\u2019s positioning within largely unchanged moral economies of human value relied on the intensive and ongoing discursive denigration of others. Remaining racially devalued even with upward class mobility, Black social workers\u2019 experiences of continued discrimination, alongside the relative class diversity among Black service providers, seems to have mitigated the classism normally inherent to social work. Most Black women welfare reformers, according to Gordon, \u201cwere usually newly middle-class, perhaps a generation away from slavery and without much cushion against economic misfortune.\u201d248 These women were living a very different experience of being middle class than that of their white contemporaries.\n\nChapman, Chris; Withers, A.J..

Edi\u00e7\u00e3o do Kindle. contemporaries.249 Knupfer, in describing the Phyllis Wheatley Club in Chicago, therefore makes the case that \u201cbecause club women were well aware of the double burden of racism and sexism which all African-American women faced, more often than not they reached \u2018across\u2019 rather than \u2018down\u2019 to their less fortunate sisters.\u201d250 The club\u2019s social work was \u201cmutual and reciprocal\u201d between poor and middle class members.251 In addition to sharing experiences of anti-Black oppression, Carlton-LaNey notes that shared Black pride also \u201cserved as a mechanism for group solidarity and helped to undercut class differences.\u201d252 It seems that race mitigated the class oppression that early Black social workers exercised, as compared to white social work at the time. However, other scholars cite historical evidence of overt and insidious classism among Black social workers too. Many of the class biases that existed in the work of friendly visitors and other white charity work were also present among Black social work organizations. For example, urban Northern social workers who provided social services to migrants from the South often looked down upon the people they were trying to help. Martin and Martin say that Black social workers, like other urban Northern Americans, perceived the migrants as \u201cuncouth, unkempt, boisterous, and ignorant.\u201d253 Northern urban social workers, Black and white, therefore engaged in what Sheila Weiss calls an \u201ceffort of the middle class to mold the behavior of the migrants in its own image [which] was clearly a one-way process. There was never any hint that the black bourgeoisie had anything to learn from its newly arrived neighbors.\u201d254 Like many other well-meaning people working to affect social change, then and now, early Black social workers often seem to have believed they knew what was best for the people they worked with. But their ideas were often informed by classist moral economies. This classed outlook was evident, for example, when Black professor R.L. Smith of Oakwood, Texas, began community organizing to make his community more aesthetically pleasing in 1889.255 As a ruling class man, he understood the physical appearance of the village to be its most pressing need. It was only after a year, when only minor issues had been resolved and people didn\u2019t follow through on more major and expensive undertakings, that he began to wonder why the response had been so lukewarm. He realized it was because the people he was working with were poor. He concluded that \u201cwhat the Negro farmers of Texas and of the South really needed was not, at this stage, a Village Improvement Society.\u201d256 If Smith had facilitated a conversation about what the community needed and how it should go about achieving those needs at the initial meeting a year earlier, their efforts may have been much more productive. Having largely done nothing for the first year, Smith now set out to reduce poverty, alongside his own aim of getting people to improve their homes and yards. He helped organize a cooperative in which farmers in the area pooled their resources, enabling two important changes: buying in bulk (obtaining discounts for volume purchases) and avoiding the use of credit, which could mean substantial savings in interest payments. After the organization had been somewhat successful in helping farmers gain financial security, an organization called the Negro Cooperative Society was founded. Smith was a supporter of the Booker T. Washington \u2013 or liberal, rather than radical \u2013 school of Black activism, and he tied the ranks in the organization to how much people had saved. Only once someone achieved the twelfth degree, and was thus named \u201cGrand Patriarch,\u201d did they gain a vote at conference.257 The richest members of the cooperative society were granted exclusive voting rights, enabling them to direct the society regardless of support from its majority. Class hierarchy and bias drove this organizational design in a clear illustration of the material effects of moral economy: those already regarded superior tend to accumulate further moral (and thus political) capital. It\u2019s assumed that those who have saved the most money are most deserving and will know best. From there, a structure is built that allows those with the most political and moral capital to gain even more institutional political power \u2013 even in this \u201ccooperative.\u201d Indeed, a large cross-section of Black social workers supported Booker T. Washington\u2019s principles, which \u201cmeasure success by the ownership of land, homes, businesses, union membership, and bank accounts.\u201d258 The class status of most Black social workers, like most social workers in general, informed their values and understandings of the world. According to Peebles-Wilkins and Francis, \u201cThese women\u2019s ideals were [ruling class] American ideals.\u201d259 They accepted the dominant views of society, working to reform some systems of oppression while leaving others intact \u2013 especially capitalism. Peebles-Wilkins and Francis suggest that Black upwardly mobile social workers, such as Mary Church Terrell, \u201cespoused fundamental, traditional American values about family, the work ethic, social obligations, democracy, and freedom that she transmitted cross-culturally.\u201d They write: \u201cThe goals of black women activists focused on uplift and contained the overtones of social Darwinism,\u201d which was the assumed social good of unimpeded competition within existing social and political structures.260 Many Black social workers, like white ones, upheld capitalism, which, after all, was the economic system permitting their upward mobility. They worked towards cumulative individual racial uplift within the parameters of existing economic and moral systems, rather than working to overhaul the system for the benefit of those suffering the most from it. Many social workers, informed by liberal individualism and prevalent moral economies of race and class differentiation, directed their change efforts at individuals rather than the social structures that caused such differentiation. Cornelius Bynum reports that \u201cAfrican American elites largely accommodated white racist assumptions about black inferiority.\u201d261 Martin and Martin suggest that established residents of the urban North \u201cfeared that the newcomers would reinforce stereotypes of black people and stir up antiblack sentiments that would have dire consequences for all black people.\u201d262 While social workers worked to \u201chelp\u201d poor people, they also often worked to normalize and assimilate members of the Black community so that \u2013 like white ruling class women \u2013 they too might gain what Fellows and Razack call a toehold on respectability.263 When social workers did explicitly set out to address systemic issues, they became burnt out, claim Martin and Martin. As a result, in the end, \u201cthey focused their attention on trying to change the character of the victims of the dominant system, helping them to cope better with their oppression.\u201d264 Social work interventions were frequently about normalizing poor Black people and getting them to conform to middle class behaviours, aesthetics, and values.265 This form of social work involved many of the same interventions that the friendly visitors stressed: cleanliness, good housekeeping, temperance, thrift, and so on. The 1921 report of Cincinnati\u2019s Negro Civic Welfare Committee of the Council of Social Agencies demonstrates that the committee was incredibly condescending and paternalistic towards working class people and enacted capitalist indoctrination. The committee operated a workplace friendly visiting program involving over 800 Black women. \u201cShe goes and gives friendly advice on punctuality, regularity, efficiency, thrift, and tries to develop in them the proper attitude toward their work.\u201d266 This committee may well have advocated for workers, and the citation above may have been written to attract donations. Yet, the report depicts this social work organization as working to improve people\u2019s lives by helping them transform into more productive capitalist subjects, something that did nothing to improve the institutionalized social, economic, political, and moral barriers they experienced. We\u2019re not saying that any of the work of early Black social workers shouldn\u2019t have been done. Rather, we can all uniquely interrogate the complexities of the past in order to better understand and interrupt patterns we may continue to replicate, uniquely positioned as each one of us is within these legacies. As bell hooks says, \u201cInterlocking systems [of oppression] indict us all in some way.\u201d267 Early Women Social Workers and Gender Roles Working to ameliorate some of the harshness caused by capitalism while upholding the system itself is similar to how many early women social workers \u2013 Black and white \u2013 approached gender. Separate spheres discourse was incredibly oppressive for women. Yet, its specific contours and divisions also created possibilities for women to take up leadership roles in what came to be called social work. Women encroached into public spaces by intervening into others\u2019 private spheres. As is true of all communities, Black women responded to gendered expectations in diverse ways. Mary Church Terrell, the honorary lifetime president of the National Association of Colored Women (NACW), largely supported separate spheres.268 However, Maggie Walker was adamantly and publicly opposed to separate spheres. Writing in 1912, she argued: \u201cThere is neither justice or good common sense in the demand that every woman should confine her activities to the domestic duties of home . . . As ability, adaptability decide these things for men, so let them decide for woman.\u201d269 Walker, the first woman bank president in the United States, supported equal rights for women, which included for her the abolition of the mores of gendered separate spheres. Furthermore, regardless of their own navigation of separate spheres, many early Black social workers advocated for suffrage and gender equality,* including Mary Ann Shadd Cary,270 Mary Church Terrell, Ida B. Wells-Barnett,271 and Maggie Walker.272 Women exposed themselves to the risks of men\u2019s patriarchal moralizing when they became active in the public sphere. For example, Henry Bibb said of Mary Ann Shadd Cary\u2019s disagreement with him about how the community should fund a school that her outspokenness \u201cwill add nothing to her credit as a lady.\u201d273 Yee explains: \u201c[W]hile Black women\u2019s participation in community-building may have been considered an acceptable extension of women\u2019s domestic responsibility beyond the private household, those who did so found themselves in a delicate balancing act.\u201d274 If Black women social workers were too outspoken, their femininity and precarious toehold on respectability could be questioned \u2013 within a patriarchal understanding in which femininity and outspokenness were antithetical. Subjugated Community-Based Social Workings Beyond Black and White The relatively large number of Black people in what\u2019s now called Canada and the United States up to the periods we\u2019re discussing is a direct result of the transatlantic slave trade. The relatively small number of migrants from Asia and other parts of the world \u2013 through to the 1960s \u2013 is a direct result of exclusionary racist immigration policies. Due to these two white supremacist practices, there were many more Black people in what\u2019s now called the United States and Canada than any other racialized groups from the Global South. However, some people from Asia and other parts of the world did migrate here. As in Black and white communities, these communities also came together in new ways to meet needs that resulted from the massive demographic shifts occurring. Most of these communities\u2019 efforts have not been as extensively documented as those in white and Black communities, making tracing their histories difficult; but this scarce documentation doesn\u2019t mean they weren\u2019t actively involved in the diverse activities of social working. Some research exists on the Chinese community in British Columbia (BC). During the era when professional social work was born, Chinese folks in BC \u201corganiz[ed] a remarkable number of voluntary mutual aid fraternal associations, partly in response to the racial discrimination they suffered,\u201d beginning soon after they first arrived in Canada in the late 1850s.275 These groups organized to fight racism, provide social services within their own community, and facilitate conflict resolution. Mutual aid groups operated in Chinese communities in BC for about a century, and were integral to the community in the face of the tremendous racist hostilities that surrounded them.276 Around the same time, the Sikh community in BC worked collectively with other South Asians to provide food, housing, and jobs for those in need; lobby the government; and fight discrimination. Today, we would call this collection of activities \u201cnewcomer settlement social work,\u201d and it\u2019s basically exactly what white and Black social workers were providing and calling social work at the time. In 1907, the Vancouver Khalsa Diwan Society was established as a Sikh religious organizing body, but, according to Norman Buchignani, Doreen Indra, and Ram Srivastava, it \u201cquickly involved itself in matters of general [South Asian] community welfare and became the focal point for subsequent South Asian battles against discrimination.\u201d277 While the initial group was Sikh, it is said to have \u201cspoke[n] for all South Asian",

In the only article we found exploring the fact that professional child welfare didn\u2019t operate in US Black communities until after legal racial segregation was abolished,\u2020 Jillian Jimenez writes: \u201cA shadow child welfare system [existed] that performed similar functions to the public child welfare system from which African American children were largely excluded.\u201d235 In apparently every Black community, people were left to do the work of \u201cchild protection\u201d and \u201cchild welfare\u201d using means that had been available to them before anybody had ever become a paid \u201csocial worker.\u201d In a recent interview about having won the Woman of Distinction Award, Black Canadian politician Zanana Akande was asked where her ethic of \u201ccontinuing to push\u201d for justice originated. In her answer, she described the informal \u201csocial workers who weren\u2019t social workers\u201d who collectively raised her when she was growing up in downtown Toronto in the 1940s and \u201950s: \u201cThat [ethic] comes from where I was born and the people around me \u2013 the first social workers who weren\u2019t social workers, because we were all raised collectively by our parents and by anyone else who happened to walk down the street and see us \u2013 that you must speak out, you must take care of each other, and you must push for what you want.\u201d236 In Black communities prior to the end of racial segregation and the introduction of child protective agencies into Black communities, practices, norms, and mores were in place to protect children from violence, respond to tragedies such as parental death, and so on. \u201cChildren routinely lived with grandparents not only in the case of death, but when one or both parents left the local area to look for work \u2026 [and] children with no family would be taken in by unrelated adults in the neighbourhood who did not have children.\u201d237 Resonant practices have existed in all communities at all times, varying significantly from place to place. Jimenez traces these specific Black child welfare practices to West African traditions of extended kinship and communal care for children, as well as to strategies later developed in response to the violences of slavery \u2013 in which Black children and adults were kidnapped, forcibly separated from one another, and held as white people\u2019s property. In the first half of the twentieth century in Black communities in the United States, the principal strategy for protecting children from abuse and neglect was community surveillance: \u201cthe extended family, especially grandmothers \u2026 aunts, great aunts, and older sisters \u2026 provided a concentric circle of approval and disapproval to support or criticize the child rearing practices of a child\u2019s primary caretakers.\u201d238 There were community-sanctioned interventions for when adults harmed children, which were rooted in community-specific hierarchies of moral and political authority. Older women relatives in Black America occupied the role only then being taken over in white America by paid ruling class strangers. One practice is a violent imposition, and the other assumes communities are capable of healing and protecting themselves; both are specific and situated means of social working to keep children safe from abuse and neglect. A very different child protection system would be in place today if families and communities were imagined capable of protecting and caring for their own children, rather than assuming the state and its professionals must do so. As a consequence of racist laws and mores, Black families were fortunate to rarely have their children apprehended by state authorities during the first half of the twentieth century. Instead, they carried on and internally adapted long-standing traditions of child protection and care. The earliest white child protection agencies were born at a time of normalized extreme anti-Black violence. Black childrearing practices at the time therefore explicitly sought to prevent children from exposing themselves to the normative violences of white supremacy;239 we can imagine the devastation that might have resulted had Black families become targeted by white social work. Black families worked to protect Black children from abusive parents and also from white supremacy. Their efforts were central to Black child protection during a time of widespread lynching and other explicit anti-Black violence. Such child protection isn\u2019t normatively validated as \u201csocial work.\u201d Of all the diverse and significant Black interventions into the social world for over a century, from slavery liberation societies through to the civil rights movement of the mid-twentieth century, there seems to have been a consensus that the approach to \u201cchild protection\u201d taken for granted among white ruling classes wasn\u2019t morally or politically acceptable. No matter how one is positioned in relation to these histories, this wholesale rejection is an astounding fact for us all to seriously reflect upon today. Class Stratification and How It Interlocked with Racism and Social Work As with white social workers, Black social workers in the United States and Canada tended to be upper or middle class people assisting poor people. Class divisions among Black people, however, had different effects and significance from those among white people, given that segregation and racism had a levelling effect on Black communities. No matter how much money you had, you often could not live in a ruling class neighbourhood if you were Black, nor was it easy to get a loan, be free from the threat of racist violence, go many places, or do many other things available to white people. Class status did not inoculate against racism. Carlton-LaNey writes, \u201cThere was very little physical, social and economic distance\u201d between those doing early Black social work and others in the communities where they worked. They \u201clived in the same communities and by virtue of race shared many of the same societal problems and issues of concern.\u201d However, those \u201cwho engaged in the emerging social work profession were among the \u2026 educated elite of the African American community.\u201d240 Educated Black women primarily provided social services,241 which could have perpetuated white ruling class social mores. Yet, Carlton-LaNey asserts that \u201clower class women were also active in clubs and formed organizations in an effort to serve themselves and the needy in their communities.\u201d242 She writes that this class diversity among workers, as well as shared experiences of racism, helped these social workers more reflexively consider their own power: even educated Black social workers with \u201cproperty ownership, poise, and eloquence \u2026 [were often] treated like \u2018washerwomen\u2019 [which] \u2026 kept them attuned to the deplorable conditions to which their less-fortunate sisters were subjected.\u201d243 Through to the 1920s, \u201ca white woman in Halifax looking for help with her laundry felt free to stop any African-Nova Scotian woman on the street and request \u2018where she could get a good girl.\u2019\u201d244 White supremacy served to homogenize Blackness so that, in practice, it was the only relevant identifier in many cases, or at least it was the identity category that trumped all others. The assumption that any Black person would know where to get a cleaner in Halifax was based on the pervasive white supremacist association of Black people with domestic service and dirt. This thinking had important social significance and was intimately tied up with interlocking moral economies of human value. At this time, eugenics was often referred to as \u201cmental hygiene,\u201d245 and Ivory Soap boasted about its ability to \u201ccivilize\u201d Indigenous people.246 This period was also the era in which white ruling class women acquired an unprecedented degree of exalted bourgeois subjectivity. Fellows and Razack explain that dirt was important in constituting these select women as separate and distinct from \u2013 and to imagine themselves morally superior to \u2013 \u201cwasherwomen.\u201d247 The renegotiation of white ruling class women\u2019s positioning within largely unchanged moral economies of human value relied on the intensive and ongoing discursive denigration of others. Remaining racially devalued even with upward class mobility, Black social workers\u2019 experiences of continued discrimination, alongside the relative class diversity among Black service providers, seems to have mitigated the classism normally inherent to social work. Most Black women welfare reformers, according to Gordon, \u201cwere usually newly middle-class, perhaps a generation away from slavery and without much cushion against economic misfortune.\u201d248 These women were living a very different experience of being middle class than that of their white contemporaries.\n\nChapman, Chris; Withers, A.J..

Edi\u00e7\u00e3o do Kindle. contemporaries.249 Knupfer, in describing the Phyllis Wheatley Club in Chicago, therefore makes the case that \u201cbecause club women were well aware of the double burden of racism and sexism which all African-American women faced, more often than not they reached \u2018across\u2019 rather than \u2018down\u2019 to their less fortunate sisters.\u201d250 The club\u2019s social work was \u201cmutual and reciprocal\u201d between poor and middle class members.251 In addition to sharing experiences of anti-Black oppression, Carlton-LaNey notes that shared Black pride also \u201cserved as a mechanism for group solidarity and helped to undercut class differences.\u201d252 It seems that race mitigated the class oppression that early Black social workers exercised, as compared to white social work at the time. However, other scholars cite historical evidence of overt and insidious classism among Black social workers too. Many of the class biases that existed in the work of friendly visitors and other white charity work were also present among Black social work organizations. For example, urban Northern social workers who provided social services to migrants from the South often looked down upon the people they were trying to help. Martin and Martin say that Black social workers, like other urban Northern Americans, perceived the migrants as \u201cuncouth, unkempt, boisterous, and ignorant.\u201d253 Northern urban social workers, Black and white, therefore engaged in what Sheila Weiss calls an \u201ceffort of the middle class to mold the behavior of the migrants in its own image [which] was clearly a one-way process. There was never any hint that the black bourgeoisie had anything to learn from its newly arrived neighbors.\u201d254 Like many other well-meaning people working to affect social change, then and now, early Black social workers often seem to have believed they knew what was best for the people they worked with. But their ideas were often informed by classist moral economies. This classed outlook was evident, for example, when Black professor R.L. Smith of Oakwood, Texas, began community organizing to make his community more aesthetically pleasing in 1889.255 As a ruling class man, he understood the physical appearance of the village to be its most pressing need. It was only after a year, when only minor issues had been resolved and people didn\u2019t follow through on more major and expensive undertakings, that he began to wonder why the response had been so lukewarm. He realized it was because the people he was working with were poor. He concluded that \u201cwhat the Negro farmers of Texas and of the South really needed was not, at this stage, a Village Improvement Society.\u201d256 If Smith had facilitated a conversation about what the community needed and how it should go about achieving those needs at the initial meeting a year earlier, their efforts may have been much more productive. Having largely done nothing for the first year, Smith now set out to reduce poverty, alongside his own aim of getting people to improve their homes and yards. He helped organize a cooperative in which farmers in the area pooled their resources, enabling two important changes: buying in bulk (obtaining discounts for volume purchases) and avoiding the use of credit, which could mean substantial savings in interest payments. After the organization had been somewhat successful in helping farmers gain financial security, an organization called the Negro Cooperative Society was founded. Smith was a supporter of the Booker T. Washington \u2013 or liberal, rather than radical \u2013 school of Black activism, and he tied the ranks in the organization to how much people had saved. Only once someone achieved the twelfth degree, and was thus named \u201cGrand Patriarch,\u201d did they gain a vote at conference.257 The richest members of the cooperative society were granted exclusive voting rights, enabling them to direct the society regardless of support from its majority. Class hierarchy and bias drove this organizational design in a clear illustration of the material effects of moral economy: those already regarded superior tend to accumulate further moral (and thus political) capital. It\u2019s assumed that those who have saved the most money are most deserving and will know best. From there, a structure is built that allows those with the most political and moral capital to gain even more institutional political power \u2013 even in this \u201ccooperative.\u201d Indeed, a large cross-section of Black social workers supported Booker T. Washington\u2019s principles, which \u201cmeasure success by the ownership of land, homes, businesses, union membership, and bank accounts.\u201d258 The class status of most Black social workers, like most social workers in general, informed their values and understandings of the world. According to Peebles-Wilkins and Francis, \u201cThese women\u2019s ideals were [ruling class] American ideals.\u201d259 They accepted the dominant views of society, working to reform some systems of oppression while leaving others intact \u2013 especially capitalism. Peebles-Wilkins and Francis suggest that Black upwardly mobile social workers, such as Mary Church Terrell, \u201cespoused fundamental, traditional American values about family, the work ethic, social obligations, democracy, and freedom that she transmitted cross-culturally.\u201d They write: \u201cThe goals of black women activists focused on uplift and contained the overtones of social Darwinism,\u201d which was the assumed social good of unimpeded competition within existing social and political structures.260 Many Black social workers, like white ones, upheld capitalism, which, after all, was the economic system permitting their upward mobility. They worked towards cumulative individual racial uplift within the parameters of existing economic and moral systems, rather than working to overhaul the system for the benefit of those suffering the most from it. Many social workers, informed by liberal individualism and prevalent moral economies of race and class differentiation, directed their change efforts at individuals rather than the social structures that caused such differentiation. Cornelius Bynum reports that \u201cAfrican American elites largely accommodated white racist assumptions about black inferiority.\u201d261 Martin and Martin suggest that established residents of the urban North \u201cfeared that the newcomers would reinforce stereotypes of black people and stir up antiblack sentiments that would have dire consequences for all black people.\u201d262 While social workers worked to \u201chelp\u201d poor people, they also often worked to normalize and assimilate members of the Black community so that \u2013 like white ruling class women \u2013 they too might gain what Fellows and Razack call a toehold on respectability.263 When social workers did explicitly set out to address systemic issues, they became burnt out, claim Martin and Martin. As a result, in the end, \u201cthey focused their attention on trying to change the character of the victims of the dominant system, helping them to cope better with their oppression.\u201d264 Social work interventions were frequently about normalizing poor Black people and getting them to conform to middle class behaviours, aesthetics, and values.265 This form of social work involved many of the same interventions that the friendly visitors stressed: cleanliness, good housekeeping, temperance, thrift, and so on. The 1921 report of Cincinnati\u2019s Negro Civic Welfare Committee of the Council of Social Agencies demonstrates that the committee was incredibly condescending and paternalistic towards working class people and enacted capitalist indoctrination. The committee operated a workplace friendly visiting program involving over 800 Black women. \u201cShe goes and gives friendly advice on punctuality, regularity, efficiency, thrift, and tries to develop in them the proper attitude toward their work.\u201d266 This committee may well have advocated for workers, and the citation above may have been written to attract donations. Yet, the report depicts this social work organization as working to improve people\u2019s lives by helping them transform into more productive capitalist subjects, something that did nothing to improve the institutionalized social, economic, political, and moral barriers they experienced. We\u2019re not saying that any of the work of early Black social workers shouldn\u2019t have been done. Rather, we can all uniquely interrogate the complexities of the past in order to better understand and interrupt patterns we may continue to replicate, uniquely positioned as each one of us is within these legacies. As bell hooks says, \u201cInterlocking systems [of oppression] indict us all in some way.\u201d267 Early Women Social Workers and Gender Roles Working to ameliorate some of the harshness caused by capitalism while upholding the system itself is similar to how many early women social workers \u2013 Black and white \u2013 approached gender. Separate spheres discourse was incredibly oppressive for women. Yet, its specific contours and divisions also created possibilities for women to take up leadership roles in what came to be called social work. Women encroached into public spaces by intervening into others\u2019 private spheres. As is true of all communities, Black women responded to gendered expectations in diverse ways. Mary Church Terrell, the honorary lifetime president of the National Association of Colored Women (NACW), largely supported separate spheres.268 However, Maggie Walker was adamantly and publicly opposed to separate spheres. Writing in 1912, she argued: \u201cThere is neither justice or good common sense in the demand that every woman should confine her activities to the domestic duties of home . . . As ability, adaptability decide these things for men, so let them decide for woman.\u201d269 Walker, the first woman bank president in the United States, supported equal rights for women, which included for her the abolition of the mores of gendered separate spheres. Furthermore, regardless of their own navigation of separate spheres, many early Black social workers advocated for suffrage and gender equality,* including Mary Ann Shadd Cary,270 Mary Church Terrell, Ida B. Wells-Barnett,271 and Maggie Walker.272 Women exposed themselves to the risks of men\u2019s patriarchal moralizing when they became active in the public sphere. For example, Henry Bibb said of Mary Ann Shadd Cary\u2019s disagreement with him about how the community should fund a school that her outspokenness \u201cwill add nothing to her credit as a lady.\u201d273 Yee explains: \u201c[W]hile Black women\u2019s participation in community-building may have been considered an acceptable extension of women\u2019s domestic responsibility beyond the private household, those who did so found themselves in a delicate balancing act.\u201d274 If Black women social workers were too outspoken, their femininity and precarious toehold on respectability could be questioned \u2013 within a patriarchal understanding in which femininity and outspokenness were antithetical. Subjugated Community-Based Social Workings Beyond Black and White The relatively large number of Black people in what\u2019s now called Canada and the United States up to the periods we\u2019re discussing is a direct result of the transatlantic slave trade. The relatively small number of migrants from Asia and other parts of the world \u2013 through to the 1960s \u2013 is a direct result of exclusionary racist immigration policies. Due to these two white supremacist practices, there were many more Black people in what\u2019s now called the United States and Canada than any other racialized groups from the Global South. However, some people from Asia and other parts of the world did migrate here. As in Black and white communities, these communities also came together in new ways to meet needs that resulted from the massive demographic shifts occurring. Most of these communities\u2019 efforts have not been as extensively documented as those in white and Black communities, making tracing their histories difficult; but this scarce documentation doesn\u2019t mean they weren\u2019t actively involved in the diverse activities of social working. Some research exists on the Chinese community in British Columbia (BC). During the era when professional social work was born, Chinese folks in BC \u201corganiz[ed] a remarkable number of voluntary mutual aid fraternal associations, partly in response to the racial discrimination they suffered,\u201d beginning soon after they first arrived in Canada in the late 1850s.275 These groups organized to fight racism, provide social services within their own community, and facilitate conflict resolution. Mutual aid groups operated in Chinese communities in BC for about a century, and were integral to the community in the face of the tremendous racist hostilities that surrounded them.276 Around the same time, the Sikh community in BC worked collectively with other South Asians to provide food, housing, and jobs for those in need; lobby the government; and fight discrimination. Today, we would call this collection of activities \u201cnewcomer settlement social work,\u201d and it\u2019s basically exactly what white and Black social workers were providing and calling social work at the time. In 1907, the Vancouver Khalsa Diwan Society was established as a Sikh religious organizing body, but, according to Norman Buchignani, Doreen Indra, and Ram Srivastava, it \u201cquickly involved itself in matters of general [South Asian] community welfare and became the focal point for subsequent South Asian battles against discrimination.\u201d277 While the initial group was Sikh, it is said to have \u201cspoke[n] for all South Asian\n\nChapman, Chris; Withers, A.J.. A Violent History of Benevolence: Interlocking Oppression in the Moral Economies of Social Working (pp. 115-120). University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division. Edi\u00e7\u00e3o do Kindle. Canadians regardless of religion.\u201d278 Because of this inclusivity, \u201cSouth Asian Muslims and Hindus \u2026 contributed money and labour to building the Vancouver Sikh temple, for they saw it as a secular rallying point for everyone from \u2018Hindustan.\u2019\u201d279 Together, they organized against British imperial rule in South Asia and Canadian government plans to deport South Asians.280 \u201cOver the next ten years South Asians battled continuously against racial subordination. In the process they developed a set of community institutions that were remarkable given the circumstances.\u201d281 Diverse Indigenous nations and communities were also actively social working throughout this period. Folks drew on long-standing traditions of mutual aid and resisted the ongoing colonial project, which specifically aimed at displacing cultural practices of sharing and helping by imposing capitalist economic systems onto Indigenous nations. In these circumstances, working against colonialism to fight assimilation and preserve traditions of helping were important interventions into the social world.282 Other Indigenous interventions into the social world at the time, which fall outside the standard account of social work history, are the many ways that parents, elders, and community members organized to prevent their children from being apprehended by the state and tried to incite change when they heard about the abuse their children were subjected to.283 The centrality of the conflict between Richmond and Addams has become standard in envisioning what social work was, is, and can be. Yet, situating the conflict between the \u201cchild protection\u201d efforts of Indigenous families, on the one hand, and the \u201cchild protection\u201d work of Indian residential schools and children\u2019s aid societies, on the other hand, as another way of thinking about the parameters and possibilities of social work would open up very different understandings of what \u201csocial work\u201d is and can be. Recently, Indigenous practices such as restorative justice are beginning to be incorporated into contemporary professional social work.284 But, as we make such much-needed changes, we should be careful to avoid telling accounts of social work history that minimize the violence with which such practices have been \u2013 and continue to be \u2013 displaced and supplanted with traditions and practices from Europe and white settler communities. Recognition of that violent suppression is part of the work of decolonization too. We also need to be cautious about exactly how Indigenous practices and traditions get incorporated. As Chris has written of their work in a colonial and disablist institution that \u201cincorporated the medicine wheel and a talking feather into our life-skills curricula,\u201d these inclusions were never permitted to interfere with institutional efficiency and violence. They \u201cwere removed from their original contexts and pasted into our institutional one, redeployed in such a way as to extend the status quo operations of institutionalization and enculturation.\u201d285 Indigenous practices can be significant in the shift towards more just and dignified possible ways for humans to come together in what is called social work,286 as can the work of countless other communities that have had their practices displaced, marginalized, and subjugated by professional social work. However, these practices should never be cut and pasted into otherwise unchanged white social work. Rather, we need to fundamentally transform the narrow and hierarchical norms and mores that are now institutionalized. The history we provide in this chapter is nowhere near complete. The diversity of examples of social work that sprang up in response to specific community concerns around the turn of the last century exceeds the number of communities that existed at the time. Social work in distinct communities looked different from one another because those communities, and their beliefs, needs, and resources, were different from one another. Such diversity \u2013 then and now \u2013 could function as an important resource for social workers today, but only if we know to look for it at all. Conclusion We have given a brief overview of early social work in the United States and Canada, focusing on Black social work because of the existing scholarship on the breadth of activities and the obvious erasures of sometimes identical activities as those included within white social work history. Presumably, like the majority of those in the helping professions today, most Black social workers at the time worked largely out of the public eye, and so their contributions will forever remain unknown to history. Community organizing and social movements are made up of many people who all make important contributions, but when these activities are recorded in history, the collectivities get translated through individualism into remarkable heroes who bravely led the way.287 This tendency alone, though, doesn\u2019t account for why so little is known within social work scholarship about Black community and social service work a century ago. Many Black leaders \u2013 such as Wells, Du Bois, and Walker \u2013 were famous around 1900 for their many interventions into the social world. And, of course, we\u2019ve clearly left countless other well-known Black figures out of this history. It\u2019s simply untrue that social work emerged only out of British and white settler efforts, as the standard account would have it. Yet, that false history continues to have concrete effects today. Because the standard account is told the way it is, radical social work scholar Mimi Abramovitz can critique that, due to \u201cracism and segregation, the settlements and the networks established by African American women never became well known or exercised much influence outside the African American community.\u201d288 While this assessment is not entirely untrue, it erases what influence they did have and the prominence some historical Black folks held, and it doesn\u2019t consider whether white folks like Addams might have been directly influenced by the sometimes earlier Black efforts. Yet, what is perhaps even more troubling is that Abramovitz can acknowledge the influence of racism and still also write, as a summary of \u201cthe history of social work,\u201d that the \u201csocial change-oriented Settlement House Movement (SHM) vied for control of the emerging profession with the older and more individually oriented Charity Organization Society (COS). This initial conflict \u2026 anticipated a century of struggle.\u201d289 We are struck by the incongruity of adding the fact that racism shaped history to that very tradition of history without reshaping the priorities which inform its telling as a result of this fact. Social work struggles with personal versus political change, certainly, but why should that particular conflict be the guiding framework for all social work history? Or why should that struggle be represented by the COS versus white settlements? Another history of social work could present the primary tension as that of the liberal Booker T. Washington camp versus the radical W.E.B. Du Bois camp, or the liberal Maggie Walker camp versus the radical Ida B. Wells camp. Like centring the conflict between Richmond and Addams, these framings would describe the tension between advocating for reform within a largely unchanged system versus working to fundamentally transform the system. Even more transformative, as suggested earlier, would be if we honoured the \u201cchild protection\u201d work done in Black communities with no institutionalized child protective services, alongside that done in Indigenous communities struggling to save their children from externally imposed professional \u201cprotection,\u201d and we took such widely diverse work as a counterpoint to the work that became institutionalized as white child protective services and Indian residential schooling. This ongoing struggle of communities taking care of their own versus external imposition is a fundamental tension that has always existed in \u201csocial work practice\u201d \u2013 and honouring or centring it might significantly shift the ways we think and feel about what we do. Maybe it would even transform what we tend to do. In their history of what they call \u201cradical social work,\u201d Michael Reisch and Janice Andrews discuss some of the work of Black organizers during the Progressive Era. However, they repeatedly make white people the reference point. For example, they write: \u201cSome early radical social workers were far more willing than their mainstream counterparts to work cooperatively with people of color and to participate in inter-racial organizations or multiracial coalitions.\u201d290 Here, the category \u201cradical social workers\u201d is represented as white. They go on to mention the work of (unnamed) Black women organizers and then emphasize Jane Addams\u2019s role in anti-racist organizing. Such representations continue to inform imaginaries of who (radical) social workers are today. While American histories of Black social work are much more concrete and accessible than Canadian ones,291 plenty of interventions into the social world in 1800s Black Ontario and Nova Scotia are well documented. These stories are not entirely hidden \u2013 the work of anti-slavery societies and Black colonizers are often disseminated during Black History Month. The opening of the Nova Scotia Home for Coloured Children brought out the biggest gathering of Black Nova Scotians in over a century,292 and one of its founders, James Johnston, had the largest funeral in Halifax since the death of Sir John S.D. Thompson, Canada\u2019s fourth prime minister, two decades earlier.293 These events were not marginal. How do they become and remain marginal stories when history gets written? Black social workers were clearly influenced by what was going on in white social work.294 Without a doubt, that\u2019s true. But white social workers were also influenced by Black social workers,295 and this reciprocity isn\u2019t acknowledged in the standard account. Most of the histories of Black social work we\u2019ve drawn upon make mention of white social work, especially of Jane Addams and her work.296 Racialized social work authors are required to demonstrate their fluency in white social work history, but white social work historians don\u2019t need to prove their credentials in relation to Black histories or any other histories outside of white settler and European communities. This double standard is due to the moral economy of white supremacy continuing to shape what gets known and done. Discussing Black social work educator and social worker George Haynes\u2019s view that Black social workers needed to learn Black history, Martin and Martin write that Haynes felt Black people are \u201cboth creatures and creators of history in that history has placed them where they are right now and has shaped their point of view, their identity, and their aspirations.\u201d297 This description is particularly true of Black people in the context of white supremacist American and Canadian history, but it can also be said to be true in site-specific ways for all of us. We are all \u201ccreatures and creators of history\u201d; history shapes what we can think, perceive, feel, do, and be \u2013 not only because of which past events occurred, but also because of which past events get told, how they\u2019re framed, from whose perspective they\u2019re told, and who gets represented as significant in their development. The exclusion of Black and racialized social workers from the standard account of social work history is a product of white supremacy, and it replicates social work as a white institution, naturalizing white people in the role of social worker and making social workers of colour seem aberrational even today. Histories centre certain figures and decentre others. Addams, a white woman, is centred while Wells and Walker are decentred. This act of narrative exaltation and marginalization has real consequences. Consider the following: Karen Lundblad writes, \u201cAs a social reformer and organizer, Addams is almost unparalleled \u2026 [and] remains an inspiration and role model for social workers today.\u201d298 We admire Addams for her work and her mind. She is indeed an inspiration. Yet, what does it mean to frame her as \u201calmost unparalleled\u201d if we consider the Black women who fought for social change, benefited their communities, and contributed to the helping professions as a whole? Further salt is added to the wound when claims of Addams\u2019s uniqueness are evidenced by her relationship with Wells, Du Bois, and other Black activists. What\u2019s forgotten is that she gravitated to them as inspirational, at the very same time as they gravitated to her. She wasn\u2019t the only inspiration in those relationships. And she doesn\u2019t have to be the only one available to us today.

Here we focus primarily on \u201cthe color-line,\u201d a phrase made famous by Black activist-scholar W.E.B Du Bois at the same time as the term \u201csocial work\u201d was coined.1 We focus on the work the colour line continues to do since his time in its framing of the Progressive Era. We reflect upon who gets credited for making history and how this choice maps onto moral economies that separate who is and isn\u2019t a valued human with something to offer our social world. In contrast to the histories most circulated, at the time the term \u201csocial work\u201d was coined, community initiatives and innovations in working with disadvantaged groups as well as efforts to transform political structures were taking place all over the world. Many of the people involved in these diverse interventions into the social world were neither Christian nor secular, and many weren\u2019t white. For example, according to Saba Mahmood, Zaynab al-Ghazali \u201cis credited with establishing a women\u2019s organization [in Egypt] called the Society of Muslim Ladies \u2026 which was initially dedicated to providing charitable services to poor women and children\u201d and later expanded to work towards structural change in collaboration with the Muslim Brotherhood.2 The Society of Muslim Ladies was established in the 1930s, and it might be imagined that al-Ghazali\u2019s efforts were made possible due to feminist successes in Europe and white settler colonies like Canada and the United States. However, Mahmood shows that al-Ghazali\u2019s interventions into the social world were \u201ca product of the sociopolitical ethos of her times and the new possibilities that were opening up for women at the turn of the twentieth century [in Egypt itself]. Al-Ghazali reached adulthood when there had already been almost three decades of women\u2019s activism in Egypt.\u201d3 There was also a proliferation of women\u2019s publications around 1900 that \u201cwas accompanied by an efflorescence of women\u2019s charitable associations, which served as the springboard for women\u2019s entry into public and political life.\u201d4 This Egyptian timeline is concurrent to, and squarely resonant with, first wave feminism in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom, as well as the rise of women\u2019s central role in providing charity that accompanied feminist movements in the Global North. In Europe and white settler colonies, histories of feminism and social work tend to be mapped onto stories of progress, which are framed as a movement away from religion and towards secularism (whether or not that fits with historical figures\u2019 understandings). Indeed, as Sherene Razack observes, \u201cthe secular/religious divide . . . functions as a color line, marking the difference between the modern, enlightened West, and people of color, notably Muslims.\u201d5 This blueprint for historical progress doesn\u2019t map well onto developments in Egypt \u2013 and not because secularism was unavailable as an option. \u201cZaynab al-Ghazali\u2019s first exposure to women\u2019s activism came at the age of sixteen when she joined the Egyptian Feminist Union (EFU), an affiliation that she reportedly later terminated because of the EFU\u2019s \u2018secular orientation.\u2019\u201d6 In reading about al-Ghazali\u2019s treatment of gender relations, it may be easy for many white readers to imagine that secular feminism is a better path towards justice. For example, \u201cthe language of \u2018women\u2019s rights\u2019 finds an important \u2026 place in al-Ghazali\u2019s speeches and writings and is often invoked to emphasize that Muslim women and men are equally called upon to serve God,\u201d7 a priority that may seem misaligned to a secular reader. However, Mahmood demonstrates the profound changes that al-Ghazali and Islamic women\u2019s movements have had on gender relations in Egypt. In her conclusion, she challenges readers with the spectre of genocide, which she suggests is implicit in secular framings of non-secular ways of being: she invites her readers to consider \u201cthat analysis as a mode of conversation [across difference], rather than mastery, can yield a vision of coexistence that does not require making other lifeworlds extinct or provisional.\u201d8 Is it possible for secular white readers in the Global North to imagine that Muslim Egyptian navigations of gender relations are just as legitimate and potentially transformative as those that are valued within secular feminism? Furthermore, what would it mean to take seriously Mahmood\u2019s challenge that we tend to approach difference as something we implicitly aim to make \u201cextinct?\u201d Histories like al-Ghazali\u2019s are left out of the standard account of social work, which traces white US settlement houses and Charity Organization Society initiatives back to white people\u2019s initiatives in the United Kingdom.9 This chapter offers a small corrective to this tendency. We do not, however, claim to offer a complete account of the story of racialized peoples\u2019 contributions to what has come to be called social work. There will always be examples left out, and our account is no exception. However, by foregrounding and naming these exclusions, and by making humble correctives to a few such exclusions, we hope to offer a context for thinking further about the kinds of interventions into the social world that are normally left out of social work history. We aim to show that these exclusions are arbitrary, in the sense of being unjustifiable; yet, at the same time, they are logically coherent within the framework of white supremacy and have real effects on people\u2019s lives and possibilities. They are arbitrary because there is no objective reason to privilege white people\u2019s accomplishments and to leave out those of racialized communities; but they are perfectly sensible and coherent within the moral economy of white supremacy. White supremacy shapes both the inclusions and the exclusions of the standard account of social work\u2019s origin. In response to these exclusions, this chapter highlights some innovations, contributions, and legacies that racialized communities have made, focusing on Black communities in the United States and Canada. The standard account of social work is simply a white account of white social work.* It ignores racialized peoples\u2019 contributions to the mishmash of interventions into our social world that has been called social work for over a century, and thus constructs social work as white in both the past and the present. The few historical figures we name, alongside countless Black anti-slavery and anti-lynching advocates, community organizers, settlement workers, and other activists and charity workers, were active in forging the foundation of modern social work. Yet, it\u2019s only recently that early Black social workers like Ida B. Wells, Mary Ann Shadd Cary, Mary Church Terrell, Reverdy Ransom, and Maggie Walker are having their histories told or read in contexts where there aren\u2019t exclusively Black students, and where these historical figures are understood to be the originators of social work (as opposed to only the originators of Black social work) that they really were. If we understand social work to include various forms of relief initiatives, as well as diverse actions aiming towards community and large-scale political and social transformation \u2013 as with the range of work done at Hull-House or by al-Ghazali and the Society of Muslim Ladies \u2013 then the distinction between what does and does not get officially designated as social work becomes increasingly arbitrary and unjustifiable. As Linda Gordon asserts, \u201cWelfare histories [have] been by definition white-centered.\u201d10 She shows that it\u2019s \u201cpossible to make the widespread welfare reform activity of minority women visible only by changing the definition of the topic and its periodization.\u201d11 Likewise, such a move shifts the understanding of the entirety of social work history. Because social workers are assumed to be white, social work within communities of colour \u2013 including that which inspired later white social workers \u2013 gets almost entirely left out. Before recounting the histories themselves, we might reflect: considering the explicit anti-Black racism and violence that was widespread in Canada and the United States at the time of social work\u2019s nominal emergence, what kinds of efforts would have made sense for Black social workers? This chapter highlights a few stories of people who were engaged in certain kinds of social welfare activity that have not been officially acknowledged as such within histories of social welfare. Histories such as these are frequently dismissed as particular to specific populations. When white people worked with other white people, the particularity wasn\u2019t noted \u2013 whiteness as particularity went unremarked. But Black social work, when discussed at all, tends to be told as Black history rather than part of a collective history. White history is told as a shared history, whereas Black, Indigenous, and racialized histories are normally deemed relevant only to their respective communities. But, considering the social and political context, it made sense for Black social workers to focus on interventions relating specifically to Black communities.* The reasons for this focus include racism, a sense of connection to those communities, a feeling of solidarity with the struggles their own neighbours were experiencing, and the recognition that their neighbours were struggling distinctly, and often more intensely, than white people living nearby (due to racial segregation and the uneven distribution of resources that has always accompanied it in practice12). Black social work was no more particular or insular than work being done within white communities. Yet Black social work, and its contributions to the world we live in, continues to be largely unacknowledged by white recorders of history, which of course includes white recorders of social work history. When white social work was first emerging, a strong and diverse tradition of Black social work was also emerging. Jane Addams is championed as the founder of radical social work, and her anti-racism is used as a prime example of how she lived her political commitments. At the same time (and earlier), however, there were massive organizing efforts on the part of Black people who were pivotal in founding radical social work. If we relieve Addams of some of the responsibility for carrying the entire tradition of social justice\u2013oriented social work practice, we can look to other historical figures and social work movements to see that alternative approaches to helping have always existed \u2013 including among professional social workers. Iris Carlton-LaNey points out that when social work was laying down its roots in white America, Black people were developing a \u201cparallel social welfare system.\u201d13 Because of racist segregation policies, many Black people could not access white social welfare programs, and Black service providers were not welcome in the majority of white organizations. In this context, Black communities\u2019 efforts focused on what at the time was referred to as \u201cracial uplift,\u201d and a number of originators of Black social work believed that Black people should deliver services for Black people. Ida B. Wells, for instance, wrote: \u201cThe Afro-American can do for himself what no one else can do for him.\u201d14 Black communities organized benefit programs, schools, adult education initiatives, community centres, healthcare clinics, homeless shelters, settlement houses, seniors\u2019 homes, youth programs, parenting education, daycares, kindergartens, recreation programs, job banks, clothing banks, ice banks, food banks, and bank banks. And yet, white people providing these types of services to white people at this time is what is called the origin of social work. Therefore, we can ask: Who gets to tell history? Who are its imagined and actual audiences? Who gets cast as the protagonists or primary characters in the stories that are told, and how does this choice affect the take-up of these stories among diverse audiences? Who benefits from these histories being told in the ways that they\u2019re told? And what role do these versions of history have in furthering the moral economies that continue to accumulate moral worth for white subjects and denigrate the imagined value of people of colour? Black Churches: Bestowing Charity and Organizing for Change There are limitless forms by which people help one another. However, resonating with Egyptian developments at this time, two of the key sites in which help became organized and formalized in Black communities were churches (especially those associated with the social gospel movement) and women\u2019s clubs (which were either secular or attached to a religious institution). The church therefore played a key role in the development of Black social work. In white social work, \u201csocial work tended to fill spaces left by the reduced role of religion in everyday life,\u201d15 but organized religion played a more central role in Black social work. This situation arose not only because of the role that organized religion played in the development of charity and aid, which also heavily influenced white social work, but also for reasons particular to Black communities. In many Black communities, churches were the only available community spaces. In many places in the United States, it was illegal for Black people to congregate in groups of more than\n\nChapman, Chris; Withers, A.J..

Edi\u00e7\u00e3o do Kindle. five people other than at church, which meant that organizing was criminalized outside of the church. According to Carter G. Woodson, a prominent Black intellectual at the time, churches were \u201cthe only institution in which [Black people could] freely exercise authority\u201d16 and pursue strategies of self-determination and self-governance.* As a result of these factors, churches were important spaces for community organizing, and they ran numerous social and political programs alongside their more traditional role of providing relief to poor people.17 Some Black people, however, were critical of the role of organized religion. W.E.B. Du Bois, for example, disparaged Black churches for not doing enough to help Black communities. In 1912, he wrote in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) publication The Crisis that the church was \u201cstill building churches when people need homes and schools, and persisting in crucifying critics rather than realizing the handwriting on the wall.\u201d18 At the same time, he recognized the importance of churches and their centrality in Black communities.19 In the conclusion to an extensive study he led on the Black church, Du Bois, with Mary Church Tyrell and Kelly Miller, recognized the significance of the church as \u201ca mighty social power,\u201d but also asserted \u201cit needs cleansing; reviving and inspiring.\u201d20 One of the key influences of social work and the helping professions in Canada and the United States was the social gospel movement.21 Social gospel originated as a reaction to the social and economic devastation that industrial capitalism caused and the absence of an appropriate response from conventional Christianity.22 Made up of radical and progressive Protestants, the movement engaged in a variety of social welfare programs. Many social change\u2013oriented churches throughout the United States implemented important social programs.23 The Institutional Church in Chicago, under the leadership of Black Reverend Reverdy C. Ransom, is one example of the social gospel movement in action. Ransom and his congregation built a settlement house that opened in 1900 and was designed to cater to the needs of the Black community.24 Ransom was a radical, encouraging people to think about adopting socialism, which he saw as a solution to racism.25 He also worked to help settle conflicts between white strikers and Black strikebreakers in Chicago.26 Resonantly, Woodson describes how a Congregational church in Massachusetts under the leadership of W.N. DeBerry established \u201ca free employment bureau, a women\u2019s welfare league, a night school of domestic training, a girls\u2019 and a boys\u2019 club emphasizing the handicrafts, music, and athletics.\u201d27 Similar programs existed in progressive Black churches across the United States and Canada.28 The social gospel movement worked in both white and Black communities to deal with the material crises that people experienced. In addition to increasing people\u2019s access to education, childcare, settlement houses, homeless shelters, and other social services,29 the social gospel movement also worked towards large-scale political change.* Carter G. Woodson, known as the \u201cFather of Black History,\u201d30 referred to the work of social gospellers as \u201csocial work\u201d in The History of the Negro Church in 1921. \u201cSeparate Spheres\u201d and Women\u2019s Clubs Following the social disruptions caused in Europe and white settler spaces by capitalist industrialization and urbanization, a new discourse of gendered mores, norms, and values emerged. This new arrangement, referred to as \u201cseparate spheres,\u201d was a system which held that respectable men and women should only occupy roles then considered gender appropriate. The resultant separation between men and women was helpful in creating possibilities for love-based companionships among ruling class women at the time, known as \u201cBoston marriages\u201d (which we discuss in the next chapter).31 It was oppressive in many other ways, however, and it furthered the moral economy of differentiated human value \u2013 valuing the supposedly men\u2019s sphere over the women\u2019s sphere. According to separate spheres discourse and mores, the public domain (politics, paid work, and so on) was to be peopled exclusively by men, and the private domain (household and family) was to be exclusively women\u2019s domain.32 These supposedly \u201ctraditional\u201d ideas have a much more recent history than we tend to think. Previously in Europe, although gender roles were segregated, local community norms and immediate family needs largely governed how, where, and with whom people spent their time. The home had often been the location of economic activity, whether for farming or cottage industries, and men and women, boys and girls would often work alongside one another on many day-to-day tasks. The notion that men should work for pay and women should tend to the home and care for the family was at best inconsistently followed, and there was no sense that it was morally superior to always segregate genders. In response to the moral panic arising due to the increased personal freedom that resulted from capitalist industrialization and urbanization, separate spheres discourse arose to police interactions between men and women. It was essentially a moral discourse. In order to demonstrate oneself as respectable, a person would only ever labour in ways then considered gender appropriate. Alongside shifting the norms and mores within ruling class culture itself, this change enabled yet another way for poor and racialized people, especially women, to be looked down upon as morally inferior: female slaves and poor women of any race could not abstain from the \u201cpublic\u201d or \u201cmen\u2019s sphere\u201d of labouring for others. Poor women worked outside of their homes to survive,33 and, obviously, slaves could not freely choose how to direct their labour. Thus, ruling class women\u2019s respectability and morality increasingly relied upon differentiating themselves from women who cooked, cleaned, and provided care in other people\u2019s homes and were considered inferior for doing so.34 Relatively well-off Black women, before and after emancipation, often demonstrated their respectability and full humanity by adhering to the dominant social mores of separate spheres. Black communities frequently adopted all or part of separate spheres norms and discourse. Of Black Nova Scotians, for example, Suzanne Morton writes: \u201cGender ideology that placed women in the home offered protection and dignity within their own community, even if it could not secure recognition from the white middle class.\u201d35 Harley explains the adherence to separate spheres norms in the context of the post-emancipation US South: \u201cGender-defined work and domestic responsibilities were symbolic of their new status.\u201d He argues that, within a white supremacist and patriarchal society, \u201csex-segregation helped to protect black women, married or single, from charges of immorality such as those made by nineteenth- and twentieth-century writers and reformers.\u201d36 The performance of separate spheres allowed select Black people to establish membership in the new middle class, which Marie Louise Fellows and Sherene Razack describe as gaining \u201ca toehold on respectability.\u201d37 Although white supremacy and patriarchy continued to shape and define their lives and possibilities, some Black women were able to accumulate the social markers of the bourgeois class (certain kinds of dress and education, avoiding labour considered unbecoming for a lady, and so on) through which they precariously entered the ranks of the middle class. As in white communities, separate spheres mores intersected with the rise of the middle class professions, which shaped selective opportunities for women to enter the public sphere \u2013 but only in roles related to the direction and surveillance of the private sphere. Women occupied paid positions in nursing, childhood education, and social welfare activities, but only rarely in more squarely male-gendered professions such as law or medicine. In Black communities, the transition to women occupying leadership roles within the female-gendered spheres seems to have been smoother than in white communities. For instance, Shirley Yee writes: \u201cBlack women often worked with Black men in building institutions that were critical to daily life. Black women\u2019s involvement in the establishment of churches, schools, and mutual aid societies reflected a long legacy of cooperation between Black men and women.\u201d She shows how \u201cBlack Canadian women continually blurred the line between public and private and tailored their own notions of \u2018true\u2019 womanhood to the realities they faced in daily life.\u201d38 In both Canada and the United States, according to Yee, \u201cthe adoption of patriarchal structures that ironically symbolized freedom also illustrated the pervasiveness of sex role ideology.\u201d However, this ideology was resisted too \u2013 or at least it was navigated in ways that seem to have been unique to Black communities: \u201cThrough their public activism, Black women maintained the interconnectedness of family and community, the private and the public \u2013 between which there was little distinction\u201d in their real lives.39 Their ability to interconnect may have been because Black women had always worked in the \u201cpublic sphere,\u201d and these social mores were only newly available to them; and it may have also reflected distinct (and surely internally diverse) gender mores and norms that had been brought over from West Africa and were preserved through slavery.40 During this time, women\u2019s clubs were one public forum for women to engage in the social governance of the private realm, discussing and acting on issues that were deemed gender-role appropriate. The 1890s saw a wave of clubs emerge in the United States that were focused not only on the home, but also on social and political reform.41 In this decade alone, clubs emerged in New York, Boston, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Jefferson City, Omaha, New Orleans, Knoxville, and Providence \u2013 and likely in smaller communities as well.42 In 1896, the National Association of Colored Women was founded by activists including Ida B. Wells-Barnett, Mary Church Terrell, Francis Harper, and Harriet Tubman, bringing Black women\u2019s clubs from across the country into a coalition.43 Women\u2019s clubs of this era were largely focused on individual and community betterment, which they called racial uplift.44 Clubs also served as a training ground for women to obtain community work and social service skills.45 With some important exceptions, these clubs were run by middle and upper class Black women, who could follow separate spheres mores for women46 and often had a college education.47 Women\u2019s clubs typically espoused domestic feminism, which, according to Nancy Cott, is \u201cwomen\u2019s assertion of private power (particularly reproductive control) within their families.\u201d48 Club women, according to Anne Meis Knupfer, \u201cperceived their roles of mother, wife, and homemaker as cornerstones to \u2018race uplift\u2019 and progress.\u201d49 They founded orphanages, settlement houses, youth clubs, kindergartens, women\u2019s education opportunities, employment services, youth/recreational programs, nursing homes, daycares, and at least one YWCA.50 Notably, these programs were all in keeping with the ideologies of domestic feminism and separate spheres. Club women helped establish many important social services and worked towards strengthening the Black community, always in keeping with those arenas of life in which it was normatively deemed appropriate for women to participate. The social and political effects of the work of Black women\u2019s clubs, like the concrete effects of Addams\u2019s and Richmond\u2019s work, were therefore complicated. They provided crucial programs and resources to communities that were usually excluded from white social work services, but they also acted to police morality and gender roles. Women\u2019s clubs worked towards reform and progress, but they also confined social service providers and recipients alike to gender roles deemed appropriate according to classed and racialized social mores.* The Great Migration: Migrant Assistance and the Shift towards Black Incarceration The \u201cGreat Migration\u201d began around 1915 and, according to Isabel Wilkerson, was \u201ca statistically measurable demographic phenomenon marked by unabated outflows of black \u00e9migr\u00e9s\u201d to Northern US states.51 In order to support the many people who were arriving in cities in the North, often incredibly poor and in need of assistance, Black people set up a number of welfare programs.52 One of the key areas of assistance was with women from the South, many of whom were targeted by predatory employment agencies that would force them into debt and, at times, horrendous working conditions. Black (and sometimes white) social workers were sent out to assist with directions, funds, a place to stay, and advocacy.53 The largest organization working with Black migrants from the South in this period was the National Urban League (NUL).54 Black social worker and social work educator George Haynes founded and led the NUL, which Elmer Martin and Joanne Mitchell Martin say had the \u201cleading, most advanced black social workers.\u201d55 The NUL monitored existing relief programs, advocating for Black people who had been treated unjustly.56 They worked to ensure economic access to Black people, which involved combatting racism and difficult social and material conditions,\n\nChapman, Chris; Withers, A.J..

Edi\u00e7\u00e3o do Kindle. conditions, and to reframe Southern Black migrants as skilled workers in the ruling class social imagination. The NUL advocated for Black migrants to become \u201cskilled, unionized industrial workers [who would be fully integrated] into the urban political economy.\u201d57 Yet, this goal was accomplished by working to assimilate the migrants to Northern and middle class mores and sensibilities. This approach, according to Martin and Martin, led to social workers focusing on changing individuals to adapt to existing social structures rather than working to change unjust social systems58 \u2013 as with most social services at the time. The demographic and social shift of the Great Migration also marked an important point in previously all-white \u201cservices\u201d that were now available to, and imposed upon, Black people. Sharon Snyder and David Mitchell discuss the profound differences in the institutionalization of communities based on race. Once slavery was abolished, the US state began the mass incarceration of Black people; by the start of the Great Migration, Black people made up the majority of people incarcerated in prisons and asylums. Due to racist segregation, Black people hadn\u2019t previously been institutionalized in poor houses and asylums during much of the nineteenth century, but this policy shifted post-emancipation, and Black people became increasingly pathologized. By 1919, for example, the political phenomena of diagnosing \u201cfeeblemindedness was so prevalent among African American children that all the black schools in one southern Georgia county had been closed.\u201d59 Now, articulated through the new eugenics discourse, all Black children were said to be uneducable. Snyder and Mitchell describe how the white supremacist pathologization of the entire population of Black people as feebleminded \u201cserved to disqualify the population as viable candidates for eugenically based [individualistic] interventions.\u201d They write that Black people therefore \u201clargely escaped the devastation of eugenics-based practices,\u201d and, as a result, it was only in \u201cthe late 1940s [that] African Americans with disabilities begin to be institutionalized along with their white counterparts.\u201d60 While this pattern seems true of medically justified institutionalization, they also observe that the mass imprisonment of Black people had begun earlier. At this time, any gender-segregated confinement was commonly rationalized as a form of eugenics with the explicitly intended effect of keeping people from reproducing. These early justifications should be kept in mind when reflecting upon the political function of prisons and other closed institutions today. From the beginning of the Great Migration, Black communities organized to provide \u201coutdoor relief,\u201d which allowed people to access goods and resources while remaining free from confinement; at the same time, white communities were beginning to massively confine many Black people in the asylums and prisons that were a legacy of an earlier move towards the \u201cindoor relief\u201d of poor white people. As was the case with the earlier shift among denigrated Europeans and white settlers,* the massive use of confinement came about because it became increasingly socially unacceptable for white people to openly and publicly kill and torture Black people,61 due to the efforts of early Black social working and activism. This new use of confinement as a primary means of the racist social control of Black people also coincided closely with the mass confinement of Indigenous children in the Indian residential school system, which the government of the Province of Canada took on as a major policy initiative in the 1840s;62 it was now also becoming increasingly socially unacceptable for white people to openly and publicly kill and torture Indigenous people.63 So, while it is true that Black, Indigenous, and racialized people largely escaped the specific violences of early eugenic policies and practices,64 this \u201cescape\u201d carries a very different meaning if intersected with concurrent histories of anti-Black lynching, western expansion, and the Indian Wars. Once such overt racialized violence became increasingly less acceptable, imprisonment, institutionalization, and Indian residential schools were massively used against racialized and Indigenous populations.65 Continuities can therefore be traced between plantation slavery and today\u2019s seemingly entirely distinct institutions of anti-Black racism. For example, Malcolm X recalled his childhood involvement with state welfare workers as so fundamentally characterized by white people shaming his mother that he considered it a legacy of rampant white shaming, denigration, and control of Black mothers during slavery; he also notes another continuity of slavery in the fact that he became the legal property of the white state once apprehended, with white social workers controlling where he lived and what he did.66 Anti-racist activists have also drawn connections between slavery and what was only then becoming today\u2019s prison system. Although US slavery was abolished in 1865 through the Thirteenth Amendment, the same legislative act named the enslavement of convicts an exception: \u201cNeither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\u201d67 This law enabled two already existing systems of violence and control to intersect and maintain the exploitation of Black labour. Laws in the North and South that targeted free Black people already existed, enabling Black people to be arrested and punished for things that no white person was criminalized for doing. Following slavery abolition, this persecution intensified with the Black Codes of 1865 and 1866.68 These codes intersected with another violent system that previously mostly targeted white convicts and hadn\u2019t yet been an instrument of anti-Black racism. The convict lease system allowed convicts to be \u201cleased\u201d to companies and forced to engage in unpaid labour (the state was paid a small sum for their labour but prisoners received nothing). Post-emancipation, in tandem with the Black Codes and the continued legality of enslaving convicts according to the Thirteenth Amendment, the convict lease system enabled the enslavement of many Black people. In 1892, Ida B. Wells documented conditions within this racist system: \u201cIn one camp it is stated that the mortality is 10 per cent per month, and in another even more than that. In these camps men and women are found chained together.\u201d She also reported: \u201cMen who failed to perform their task of mining from two to four tons of coal per day were fastened to planks by the feet, then bent over a barrel and fastened by the hands on the other side, stripped and beaten with a strap.\u201d69 Although fewer people were subjected to this system than had been subjected to slavery, the experiences of those subjected to convict leasing weren\u2019t particularly different from slavery. A similar pattern of reform functioning simply to reorganize power followed the civil rights gains and abolition of legal racial segregation a century later. One racist system was abolished, and other long-existing systems of control and violence (previously used mostly against marginalized white people) now became mobilized in anti-Black racism: \u201cchild protective systems\u201d didn\u2019t normatively target Black families until the end of racial segregation,70 psychiatry began to target folks active in Black Power movements, so that \u201cschizophrenia became a Black disease;\u201d71 and the US prison system has expanded monumentally since the gains of Black Power movements. There\u2019s a clear relationship between the inheritances of slavery and the ongoing white supremacist structural violence of the prison system. Due to the specific context of the historical emergence of the prison and the shared characteristics of certain power relations in slavery and imprisonment, Angela Davis invites her readers to consider: \u201cIs racism so deeply entrenched in the institution of the prison that it is not possible to eliminate one without eliminating the other?\u201d72 In addition to continuities dating back to slavery in today\u2019s anti-Black racism, new racist stories emerged in the wake of slavery abolition that serve to pre-empt and delegitimize critique of the white supremacist prison system. Post-emancipation, Black people were subjected to the tremendously harsh and arbitrary Black Codes and thus were incarcerated as a result of structural anti-Black racism rather than due to committing a disproportionate number of crimes. However, critique was pre-empted within white consciousness when \u201cduring the 1870s the growing number of black prisoners in the South further buttressed the belief that African Americans were inherently criminal.\u201d73 This belief dovetailed with concurrent developments in eugenic criminology that claimed to scientifically prove that some people were \u201cborn criminals.\u201d74 While eugenic criminology tended to target marginalized white people (due perhaps to the continuous violence of anti-Black lynching and the eugenic belief that every single Black person is unfit75), the notion of an inherent criminality intersected with new discourses of anti-Black racism at the time of slavery abolition. As a result, we\u2019ve inherited and continue to perpetuate the enduring, false, and clearly racist notion that Black people are more prone to crime than white people. Black Settlement Houses Settlement houses were also founded in Black communities during the Progressive Era. The standard account of the development of social work depicts settlement houses as following a model imported from the United Kingdom, but Ralph Luker argues that these institutions were strongly influenced by missions established by Northern Black churches in the South starting in 1869, six years after slavery was abolished in the United States. These missions shared similar ideas and practices, and sometimes staff. Luker calls these Black missions \u201cproto-settlement houses.\u201d Many were developed by Black religious organizations, others by white religious or philanthropic organizations.76 These \u201cproto-settlement houses\u201d were created to address the difficulties many Black people in the South faced post-emancipation, and they preceded the first settlement house in the world (Toynbee Hall, in London, England) by fifteen years. In 1890, the year after Jane Addams and Ellen Gates Starr founded Hull-House, Janie Barrett founded the Locust Street Settlement in Virginia, which is officially the first \u201csettlement house\u201d for Black people.77 The timeline, however, may prove a little more complicated. The Locust Street Settlement grew out of a service Barrett had been providing in her own home for several years previous to this point.78 But Hull-House didn\u2019t emerge the previous year with the breadth of services it would later come to offer; it started much more humbly, initially only providing childcare for working women.79 What this complication means is that Barrett had initiated some of the work, later called the settlement work of the Locust Street Settlement, several years before Addams had even devised the idea of opening a \u201csettlement house\u201d of her own. Does that timeline mean Barrett should get credit for the first US settlement house? Maybe, maybe not.* But it certainly makes a difference to how this history tends to be framed. As discussed in the previous chapter, origin stories matter. They make a difference to how social work is conceived, how race is conceived, and how the two are imagined to intersect with one another. If Hull-House was only the first American \u201csettlement house\u201d in name, or even only \u201cthe first white settlement house,\u201d as opposed to being the first settlement house in terms of what it did, then surely this alternative timeline complicates the account that tends to be told about the birth of social work. If concrete and acknowledged antecedents to settlement work are found in earlier Black social interventions, this finding complicates accounts we tend to tell about a number of things, from social work to the role of Black people in shaping the world more generally. At least eleven Black communities had settlement houses by 1910, and several had more than one (Philadelphia had at least three). Black missions or settlements (the name is significant: \u201cmissions\u201d underscores that these predated Hull-House and even Toynbee Hall; \u201csettlements\u201d mobilizes the moral economies of white supremacy and secularism to bestow a certain legitimacy to this Black \u201csocial work\u201d) provided a plethora of services and programs, including schools for students and future teachers, healthcare services, agricultural conferences, mothers\u2019 meetings, short-term housing, daycare, and the distribution of coal and food. Some also conducted social science studies of the Black communities they served.80 Woman\u2019s Christian Temperance Union Another important part of social work history that often gets left out of the standard account is temperance organizing. In the mid- to late nineteenth century, the temperance movement was large and very influential. The largest temperance organization was the Woman\u2019s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), founded in 1874. The WCTU had a massive woman-run publishing operation \u2013 producing 125,000 pages in 1890. In Canada, the first WCTU chapter was founded in Ontario in 1877; the Dominion WCTU, Canada\u2019s national organization, was founded in 1888. The Canadian WCTUs were modelled after and mentored by the American WCTU and had their strongest support in rural areas.",

Of the uneven relationship at the time between anti-Black lynching and disablist eugenics, one illustrative event was the murder of a \u201cseventeen year old boy by the name of Jesse Washington \u2026 in 1916,\u201d which is the year after the cornerstone eugenic criminology text, The Criminal Imbecile, was published.108 James Allen says that Jesse Washington was \u201cseriously mentally challenged. The wife of the farmer he worked for was found dead.\u201d109 Jesse was tried and convicted. From Rafter\u2019s history of eugenic criminology, we might expect that Jesse would have been given an indefinite prison sentence, resulting in a eugenically rationalized lifelong incarceration due to his intellectual disability \u2013 although in Texas, where he was killed, he may have been more likely confined to an asylum for his life. Regardless, neither of these things took place. Instead he was dragged out of the courtroom, kicked down the steps, tortured, burned alive, castrated, had his fingers cut off one by one, and hanged. \u201cThere were 16,000 people crowding the street to watch this boy be tortured \u2026 [T]here were cheers, like at a football game, cheering the torturers on.\u201d Perhaps Jesse was partly targeted because he was disabled, but he was publicly tortured and murdered because he was Black.110 Ida B. Wells-Barnett Black communities fought vigorously to abolish lynching. One of the most prominent anti-lynching activists was Ida B. Wells (Wells-Barnett,\u2020 following her marriage).111 She was also a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the National Association of Colored Women, and was active in the women\u2019s club movement. In 1884, she first gained wide recognition for refusing to move from an all-white train car and for winning a settlement against the railroad.112 Wells wrote a condemnation of lynching in Memphis\u2019s Free Speech and Headlight after her friend Tom Moss was lynched for defending himself from white men\u2019s physical attacks in 1892. Due to the response to this condemnation, she was forced to flee the South. She recalls: \u201cIt was for the assertion of this fact, in the defense of her own race, that the writer hereof became an exile; her property destroyed and her return to her home forbidden under penalty of death.\u201d113 Nevertheless, she continued to agitate against lynching. In 1899, she wrote and circulated a pamphlet, \u201cLynch Law in Georgia,\u201d to Black communities in Chicago. She wrote: \u201cThe real purpose of the savage demonstrations is to teach the Negro that in the south he has no rights that the law will enforce. Samuel House was burned to teach the Negroes that no matter what a white man does to them, they must not resist.\u201d114 In response to dominant framings of anti-Black lynching more generally, and specifically to Jane Addams\u2019s acceptance of this normative white framing in her own condemnation of lynching, Wells demonstrated that most lynchings didn\u2019t involve even a claim* that the murdered man had raped a white woman.115 She showed that many of the lynchings committed on the grounds of sexual assault by Black men against white women were actually white responses to consensual interracial relationships, which were considered unacceptable within interlocking white supremacist patriarchal moral economies.116 White men had only recently lost unmitigated sexual access to the Black women they owned in law, regardless of these women\u2019s desires and consent, with the end of slavery.117 The predominant white account of lynching at the time was that white women were regularly raped by Black men, but Andrea Smith challenges the fictitiousness of this narrative: \u201cIn fact, Black women needed protection from white men.\u201d118 Indeed, Wells-Barnett\u2019s grandmother was a slave and her father a slave-owner\u2019s son \u2013 so he was likely a child who resulted from rape, as was common during slavery.119 Although fictitious, the prevalent notion that white men had to lynch Black men in order to save white women from Black rape was so pervasive that Hollywood\u2019s first blockbuster, The Birth of a Nation, which had the highest grossing ticket sales until Gone with the Wind twenty-four years later,120 depicts what claims to be a historical account of post-Civil War reconstruction and glorifies the founding of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) and a lynching in response to a Black man raping a white woman.121 When considering the views of Smith and Wells-Barnett on lynching Black men accused of raping white women, it\u2019s important to note that white men who raped any woman of any race were never lynched. In fact, most often there was no consequence at all. Contemporary readers should remember this point if they find Wells-Barnett\u2019s handling of rape and sexual assault accusations troubling due to having been socialized within second wave feminism\u2019s crucial politicization of sexual assault and the importance of believing those who say they\u2019ve been sexually assaulted. That indispensable lesson needs to be taken into account, alongside a concern about white supremacist framings of Black and racialized men as particularly prone to rape and other patriarchal violence. Of course, even consensual relationships can involve sexual assault \u2013 a point which could be said to become lost within Wells-Barnett\u2019s claim that the issue pertains to race and not sexual assault as the (interracial) relationship was consensual. (That, said, it was not until the 1970s in the United States122 and in 1983 in Canada123 that men could be held legally responsible for raping their wives.) However, it doesn\u2019t appear Wells-Barnett believed that rape never happened. But she was fighting against the ruse by which rape (real or fictitious) was used to excuse lynching. Like many other Black feminists, Wells-Barnett understood how gender and race interlocked, and she fought against this interlocking oppression rather than against racism or sexism in isolation. Carlton-LaNey writes of such anti-lynching work, saying that Black women at the time \u201crecognize[d] the political nature of sexism long before their white counterparts.\u201d Wells-Barnett and other early Black social workers \u201cfaced the fact that sexual exploitation and violence were perpetuated by both African American and white men.\u201d Carlton-LaNey therefore argues that \u201cpoliticizing sexual exploitation and harassment for African American women placed it squarely within the context of race. Combatting sexual exploitation, therefore, was inextricably linked to race uplift.\u201d124 Early anti-racist feminism did not minimize sexism or sexual assault; rather, it politicized sexism, sexual assault, and responses to them in multiple directions. Andrea Smith begins her chapter \u201cSexual Violence as a Tool of Genocide\u201d by troubling Susan Brownmiller\u2019s second wave white feminist assertion that rape \u201cis nothing more or less than a conscious process of intimidation by which all men keep all women in a state of fear.\u201d Smith uses this statement as a springboard to explore how racism and colonialism shape the particulars of what rape is.125 Likewise, Wells-Barnett was centrally concerned with situating rape and rape discourse within what contemporary feminists call interlocking oppression, as evidenced by her repeated discussions of gender and race and, to a lesser extent, class.126 Such early anti-racist feminist understandings of interlocking oppression trouble the common history of feminism in which interlocking analyses are a recent development initiated by Black feminists such as the Combahee River Collective,127 Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw,128 Patricia Hill Collins,129 Angela Davis,130 Audre Lorde,131 and bell hooks.132 Without minimizing the importance of Black feminism since the 1970s (which often honours earlier Black feminist history), the Black feminist struggle to work against interlocking oppression goes back to the first wave of feminism, which is largely left out of white histories of feminism. It\u2019s not that we wish to reduce the importance of recent anti-racist feminist authors and activists; it\u2019s that remembering the earlier anti-racist feminists raises troubling questions about how feminism\u2019s history up to the 1970s came to be recorded as yet another white history. After fleeing the South, Wells-Barnett organized anti-lynching organizations in a number of states.133 These and other anti-lynching campaigns were hugely influential in Black communities in the United States. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) emerged from anti-lynching activists. Founded in 1909 by a mixture of some of the Black community organizers we\u2019re discussing in this chapter \u2013 Wells-Barnett, Terrell, and Du Bois \u2013 and some white activists (including Addams), the NAACP has worked for racial equality for over a century and is still active today.134 White Social Work and Anti-Lynching Addams and Wells-Barnett were contemporaries and allies in numerous political struggles.135 Although Addams was somewhat exceptional (for a white person) for her commitment to anti-racism, including her activism against lynching, she also accepted that aspects of the white supremacist connection between sexual assault and lynching were true. She was a member of the NAACP at the time, yet she felt entitled to do and say things that appear to have been unaccountable to the experiences of Black communities. According to Wilma Peebles-Wilkins and E. Aracelis Francis, Addams \u201cdid not seem to understand that lynchings involved innocent victims and were not just an unacceptable response to crime.\u201d136 Addams accepted the view that Black men posed a threat to white women and white communities, but objected to lynchings on the grounds that they were not an effective deterrent to this kind of violence and punishment for crimes should be left to the legal system. She also wrote that lynchings were effective in reducing crimes committed by Black men because \u201ccertain elements of the self can be prevented from coming into action,\u201d but pointed out that this inhibition was only a temporary fix because these \u201celements of the self\u201d might resurface.137 Addams\u2019s analysis was shaped by her whiteness and her class positioning, by moral economies of white supremacy, and by discourses stressing the importance of the rule of law and Black men\u2019s criminality. Like Addams, Willard of the WCTU also didn\u2019t understand that lynching was used to control and terrorize Black people. The WCTU refused to allow Wells to address its annual national assembly in 1893. The following year, Wells secured the sponsorship of an organization to ensure that she could address the meeting. She wanted to confront the WCTU\u2019s failure to publicly condemn the lynching of Black men.138 Wells\u2019s insistence on confronting Willard and the WCTU was provoked by an 1890 interview in which Willard made several racist comments about Black people. Willard\u2019s remarks included reiterating the notion that Black men pose a threat to the safety of women and children. She said of white Southerners: \u201cThe problem in their hands is immeasurable. The colored race multiplies like the locusts of Egypt. The grog-shop [liquor store] is a center of power. The safety of women, of childhood, of the home is menaced.\u201d139 Willard thus reiterated the frequent justification of lynching due to the supposed threat that Black men posed to white women. It is particularly concerning that one of the earliest organizations combatting violence against women reified the idea that Black men were exceptionally violent towards women and failed to condemn the racist violence of lynching. When Wells identified Willard\u2019s position as untrue and racist, Willard defended her position. However, she added: I wish I had said then, as I do now, that the immoralities of white men in their relations with colored women are the source of intolerable race prejudice and hatred, and that there is not a more withering curse upon the manhood of any nation than that which the eternal laws of nature visited upon those men in those homes in which the helpless bondwoman was made the victim of her master\u2019s base desire.140 While Willard continued to claim that Black men posed a sexual threat to white women and girls, she attempted to soften her claims with the acknowledgment that white men also posed a threat to Black women and girls. But, as Mattingly observes, Willard\u2019s condemnation of white men was \u201csituated primarily in the past and associated with the evils of slavery.\u201d141 In effect, Willard was saying that white men may have once posed a threat to Black women and girls, but now it is only Black men who are still dangerous. In response to building pressure, including the condemnation of the WCTU by other prominent Black social justice organizers, the WCTU passed a resolution against lynching in 1895. The resolution stated defensively that the WCTU \u201cought never to have been placed in the position of having to defend themselves from the charge that they favored the lynching of any human being, anywhere, under any circumstances.\u201d142 It also claimed that people \u201cmisrepresented our position,\u201d likely referring to Wells, Ransom, and others who demanded that the WCTU actively and publicly condemn lynching. Coming across this story from about 120 years ago, we recognize the still all-too-familiar pattern within social justice work\n\nChapman, Chris; Withers, A.J.. A Violent History of Benevolence: Interlocking Oppression in the Moral Economies of Social Working (pp. 096-101). University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division. Edi\u00e7\u00e3o do Kindle. and beyond. Rather than deeply reflecting on her position, this white person in a leadership position, and the organization under her direction, dug in their heels and refused to acknowledge the harm they\u2019d caused. The white people thus claimed their own innocence143 and, worse still, depicted themselves as wronged for having been accused of racism. The implication is that the Black community organizers who challenged the organization\u2019s position were overreacting, too sensitive, and too angry \u2013 all of which reaffirms white supremacist anti-Black stereotypes. For this reason, these stories of Wells, Willard, and Addams are not only important as history but also as examples of how people today who claim to be allies need to be reflexive and of when they should defer to the lead of those most directly affected by an issue. Our aim here, with respect to Addams and Willard, is to paint a more complex picture of them \u2013 particularly of Addams. We\u2019re all formed by discourses, practices, and moral economies of interlocking oppression. They shape what we can know, believe, and perceive. It\u2019s not that this shaping is out of the realm of our influence or that either woman is innocent. Recognizing these complexities and holding their positive anti-oppressive practice in tension with the clearly racist, classist, and otherwise oppressive things they did is useful in helping us all understand that we\u2019re complicit in oppression even when working against it. Acknowledging this complicity is a crucial part of critical or anti-oppressive practice.144 Early Black social workers were not perfect either. Like everyone else, they were flawed people with imperfect politics who sometimes did oppressive things and often held problematic views about other people. They were part of the project of social work\u2019s new and politically complicated interventions into the social world, and sometimes this project brought an increase in surveillance, assimilation, classism, cisheterosexism, and social control into Black communities. We don\u2019t want to paint a picture of any of these figures as perfect, because we can only follow in the footsteps of the types of people that we know to have existed. As Davis asks of representations of Martin Luther King, Jr: \u201cHow could you possibly measure up to someone like that?\u201d145 She stresses that the Montgomery bus boycott \u2013 widely considered the birth of the civil rights movement \u2013 was started by ordinary people just like any one of us, and she emphasizes how important it is for us to know this in order to open possibilities for considering what role we might play in fundamental social transformation. Maggie L. Walker and the Independent Order of St Luke Maggie L. Walker\u2019s record of significantly intervening into the social world begins with her participation in what is believed to be the first anti-segregation school strike by Black students in the United States in 1883. She went on to become a teacher and part-time worker at an insurance company and later was hired as the secretary for the Independent Order of St Luke in Richmond, Virginia. The order had been founded in 1867 by former slave Mary Prout in Baltimore.146 Lily Hardy Hammond, writing in 1922, describes the Order of St Luke when Walker first came on board as \u201ca little benefit society in Richmond \u2013 one of probably a dozen or two,\u201d which had around 1,000 members. These societies were commonplace in Black communities where \u201csickness [was] a catastrophe such as only the poorest people can fully comprehend.\u201d The society paid its members out of dues if a member became sick or died, \u201cthus saving the family from what is often, among the very poor, a crushing burden of debt.\u201d147 At a time when nation-states were just beginning to offer workers\u2019 compensation themselves, local collective organizations, included this one started by Prout, acted as a social safety net. Working class people, including Black people and recent immigrants, would cumulatively contribute to a fund, and the collective would then support them from that fund if they needed it.148 The gradual development of private disability, workers\u2019 compensation, and life insurance are commonly described as contributing to the development of the modern welfare state and as a key part of social work history.149 Walker worked to expand services; by 1922, there were 100,000 members with the organization across twenty-one states. Walker also started the St Luke\u2019s Herald, which provided community and organizational news, and covered topics that preoccupied social work publications of the day such as \u201chealth, thrift, morals, and education.\u201d150 The Herald also provided detailed accounts of lynchings, segregation, and racism. The order adopted political positions, including supporting universal suffrage and anti-lynching efforts. It led the Richmond streetcar boycott against segregation in 1904.151 The Independent Order of St Luke created a bank in 1903 under Walker\u2019s direction. Walker thus became the first woman president of a bank in the United States. The bank provided financing for Black people to buy homes and go to college, among other things.152 These funds would have been otherwise difficult or impossible for Black people in the South to obtain. The predominantly circulated history of the credit union is that it was spread by Desjardins to the United States in 1908.153 Credit unions began in Germany, and had begun to be established in Qu\u00e9bec by Alphonse Desjardins in 1900 to help low-income people secure credit. Walker\u2019s bank seems to have been aligned with the ethos of early collectivist credit unions. When such work is undertaken by a disadvantaged racialized group to provide services for those who couldn\u2019t otherwise access them due to racial segregation and rampant poverty, it is a significant intervention into the social world, enabling people to better navigate and mitigate capitalism\u2019s violences. In 1909, Walker wrote that she wished to \u201cturn the course of that almighty stream of dollar, and see if we can till our own barren lands, feed our own hungry, and clothe our own naked.\u201d154 Yet, this bank is not considered part of credit union history. Like many other early women social workers of her time, Walker was also involved in club work. She founded a Richmond Council of Colored Women, which did community service and fundraising.155 When given the opportunity, Walker and other community members fundraised to establish a home for young women, with help from a white philanthropist. According to Walker, \u201cThe white philanthropist \u2026 said that if we colored women would show our interest in social work among our people by raising a thousand dollars for it, he would give us the use of a large house, and if we made good, he would deed it to a board of white and colored women for colored work.\u201d156 In response to this possibility, the community raised the money, and the women established the home. Walker said that white women in Richmond \u201chad done fine community work for white people,\u201d but that, with respect to this project, \u201cthe white women don\u2019t work for us, \u2013 they work with us.\u201d157 Walker worked with whomever was necessary, doing whatever was necessary, to help the Black community of Richmond and, indeed, the whole country. However, if you check the index of any social work text that is not specifically about Black social work, it is almost guaranteed that you won\u2019t find her name there. The Social Work Profession, Social Science, and Education Through the Progressive Era, many professions were not accessible to Black people in Canada and the United States because of the racist, segregationist educational and economic systems. Francille Wilson writes that the only two professions open to Black people were \u201cteaching and preaching,\u201d158 neither of which required a degree at the time. Social work had the potential to be yet another accessible profession for Black people,159 given that it was outside the systems of governing accredited bodies and academic programs (unlike law and medicine, by this time). Decent paid jobs were frequently obtainable for Black social workers in a number of social sectors, although often in segregated agencies or departments.160 The availability of social work jobs may, in part, explain why an increasing number of Black (and white) men entered the profession, which had previously been considered women\u2019s work.161 In fact, differentiating social work from charity often mapped onto differentiating the work that men were doing from that which women had been doing previously.162 An increasing emphasis on the use of social science was present in Black social work at the time. In the late nineteenth century, W.E.B. Du Bois started doing sociological studies of Black communities that served to identify their needs and combat racist notions about them.163 Some social science emphasized the desire to take social work out of the hands of the churches,164 but social science was taken up by social gospellers as well.165 As in white social work, a belief in the importance of systematic and scientific social work was commonly held by Black social workers across the political spectrum during this period.166 Black social workers also developed social work educational programs, with the first undergraduate program beginning in 1911.167 George Haynes, co-founder of the National Urban League (discussed earlier), established the program at Fisk University and advocated that an understanding of Black history was necessary for Black people to conduct effective Black social work.168 Haynes was motivated by the desire to ensure that Black service users were served by Black workers and that Black social workers did not become a professional underclass because they had fewer academic credentials.169 The first social work graduate program at a Black educational institution was established in 1922 at Atlanta\u2019s Morehouse College,170 and several other programs were created around the same time.171 Although social work programs had previously been available in white institutions, they did not teach from a Black perspective or address needs that were considered important in Black communities. Black Social Work in Canada Black social work in Canada has a number of similarities to the US history: churches played a major role in community work, reform efforts, and charity; there was a strong tradition of neighbour-to-neighbour helping and community improvement; and women took on important organizing roles, particularly with respect to schools and anti-slavery organizing.172 However, because Black communities were so much smaller in Canada than in the United States, and because of other factors such as political economy, geography, and climate, there were important differences too. The level of formal organization that occurred in the United States was simply not present in Canadian Black communities during the Progressive Era.173 Nonetheless, Black social work and social workers made important contributions to their communities and to the emerging profession of social work. Canada had a significant Black population for a number of reasons, including its own legacy of slavery, which began in 1628 when the first African slave was brought to what is now called Canada.174 The main sources of Black immigrants to Canada were slaves who accompanied British loyalists during the American Revolution, escaped slaves from Jamaica (known as the Maroons), freemen after the War of 1812, escaped American slaves through the Underground Railroad, and free US Black people trying to avoid American racism.175 Black communities in Canada during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were largely found in Ontario (called Upper Canada, Canada West, and the Province of Canada at various times) and Nova Scotia,176 although there were also notable populations on Vancouver Island177 and in Montr\u00e9al178 and several smaller cities.179 This settlement pattern was largely a product of the proximity of these English-speaking areas to the United States. Some Black settlers also migrated to the western provinces, but the government instituted anti-Black immigration policies before their numbers could rise significantly, as we discuss in chapter 4.180 Many US regions where Black people were legally \u201cfree\u201d had Black Laws or Black Codes, which seriously restricted the freedom and ability of many Black people to settle. This legal framework was yet another reason some Black people immigrated to Canada.181 In 1850, the US government passed the Fugitive Slave Act, allowing for the arrest of any escaped slave anywhere in the United States and requiring that person\u2019s return to their former \u201cowner.\u201d182 In the years following the passage of this act, around 50,000 former slaves* immigrated to Upper Canada.183 (To provide some perspective, the population of Toronto, called York at the time, was only 100,000 in 1841.184) Settlements in Canada A number of settlements were intentionally established as communities for escaped slaves and other Black people seeking a better life outside the pervasive and institutional racism of the United States. While this organizing has not been traditionally depicted as social work, those responsible for these initiatives were clearly engaged in making individuals\u2019 lives better,\n\nChapman, Chris; Withers, A.J..

Edi\u00e7\u00e3o do Kindle. strengthening their communities, and undertaking many efforts that would later be called social work when white people did the same things for recent immigrants from Europe. It should be noted, though, that in spite of Canada\u2019s depiction as a refuge for Black people, many were surprised to find extreme racism in Canada as well.185 This hostility, as well as the difficulty of living off the land, meant that most people in the settlements had very difficult lives. A group of Black people who lived in Cincinnati organized to leave the city and travel to Canada in 1829. Cincinnati was a trading hub with the South, and white power brokers ensured that it was inhospitable to Black people.186 The city enforced the state\u2019s Black Laws, requiring, among other things, that new Black residents pay a $500 bond to ensure that they would be of good behaviour.187 In 1829, massive anti-Black race riots took place in Cincinnati. In an attempt to quell the violence and protect their families and property, about 300 Black men agreed to a government plan to voluntarily go to jail.188 This removal of adult men from the community did not quell the white attacks. However, according to Woodson, when the rioting ended, a number of the men who had surrendered themselves \u201cwere discharged on certificates of nativity, others gave bond for their support and good behavior, a few were dismissed as non-residents, a number of them were discharged by a justice of the Court of Common Pleas, and the rest were held indefinitely.\u201d189 Black men who had voluntarily agreed to be incarcerated in the hopes of staving off white violence were forced into forms of bail bonds, driven from the city, or indefinitely imprisoned. Prior to this incident, a group of local organizers had been planning to create a community in Ontario. The organizers likely chose an isolated rural area because they wanted to protect their community from white racism and aspired to achieve economic self-sufficiency.190 The numbers swelled after the riot; somewhere between 460 and 2,000 people fled to Canada. They settled in a community they called Wilberforce, near London, Ontario.191 Over the next decade, a school, stores, and farms were established. Wilberforce is depicted as a failure in the historical literature, but Nikki Taylor notes that the settlement met its original goal of independence.192 One of the reasons it was ultimately unsustainable was that the Canada Land Company, the Crown corporation that sold land to settlers, stopped selling land to Black settlers due to protests from white settlers in the region and the common white supremacist belief that Black people were not reliable enough to uphold their contracts.* In comparison to other settlements, Wilberforce was thus quite short lived. Yet, it provided an escape for many people fleeing racist violence and the Black Codes. Another settlement established near Windsor by the Refugee Home Society was founded in 1851,193 the year after the Fugitive Slave Act was passed and a mass exodus from the United States to Canada began in response. The Refugee Home Society offered a land-granting program with a systematic approach for providing assistance. Fugitive slaves were granted land (twenty-five acres, five acres of which were free). Settlers were then given nine years to pay for the remaining land, and the profits from the venture went into operating a school and continuing the organization\u2019s work, such as buying more land.194 One of the men credited with founding the Refugee Home Society is Henry Bibb. According to Fred Landon, Bibb believed that \u201cthe future of the people of color in Canada depended upon getting them settled on the land and his mind turned to the possibilities of establishing a distinctly Negro colony.\u201d195 For Bibb and the many Black people who lived in, organized, and supported Black colonies, this venture was a liberatory project. For the people who found refuge in Canada, it was also a liberatory project. Yet, while this designation is straightforwardly true, these Black people were also setting up colonies within a white settler colony. Celebrating Bibb in 1920, Landon titled his article \u201cHenry Bibb, a Colonizer.\u201d Bibb saw his chance for freedom for himself and his community as an active part of the colonial process. What was justice for his community helped sustain an injustice for another. Noticing how this one intensely oppressed group was complicit in the oppression of Indigenous people is, by no means, an attempt to undermine the horrors of slavery, including kidnapping, rape, enslavement, torture, and murder. Escaped slaves and other Black people were not wrong to flee to Canada. It was necessary for self-preservation, born of a context in which Black people had mostly come to the Americas through the brutality of the transatlantic slave trade. Bibb\u2019s colonizing can therefore be clearly distinguished from Europeans\u2019 choice to become part of the colonial project. However, it complicates things that former slaves adopted the role of settler. As Sunera Thobani describes, the colonial context of Canada (and the United States) results in any settlement and citizenship being complicit in the continued dispossession of Indigenous peoples\u2019 lands and sovereignty.196 Importantly, she notes this complicity alongside a careful study of the racism experienced by racialized immigrants in Canada, and she suggests that unless fundamental change is made at the level of what the nation is and its relationship to Indigenous communities and nations, the colonial complicity of all settlers remains an unresolvable dilemma. Mahmood says that agency lies not only in resisting social norms but also in how one inhabits norms. Whether in relation to Black women following the mores of separate spheres or escaped slaves taking up the work of colonization, clearly only so many options were available to long-denigrated peoples to enable them to survive and perform respectability. They may have reinforced oppressive mores and underlying moral economies of human value by doing what they did, but perhaps this contradiction might serve to invite us to reflect upon how each of us today uniquely inhabits oppressive mores, outside the simple framings of resistance versus complicity.197 Like many others, Bibb escaped slavery by becoming a colonizer. To complicate matters even further, the \u201cowner\u201d from whom he escaped was Indigenous.* Bibb wrote of his former slave master: \u201cHe was the most reasonable, and humane slaveholder that I have ever belonged to.\u201d He wrote that he would rather be owned by an Indigenous person than a white person.198 Yet, he was nevertheless this other man\u2019s legal property. Encouraging slave ownership was a US government tactic of assimilating Indigenous people in the South;199 it was a way Indigenous people were encouraged to inhabit \u201ccivilized\u201d mores. Certainly, some Indigenous people having owned slaves does nothing to cancel out or trump colonial injustices. Furthermore, Indigenous nations\u2019 responses to Black slavery were as diverse as the nations themselves. The Cherokee nation is said to have engaged in the most extensive Black slave ownership of all Indigenous groups: by the 1860s, the 17,000 members of the Cherokee nation owned 4,000 Black slaves.\u2020 The Seminole and Tuscarora nations, in contrast, provided safe haven for escaped slaves, resulting in many mixed relationships.200 Indigenous people had also been forced into slavery by Europeans and white settlers, starting with Columbus in 1492.201 Alan Gallay estimates that the British were involved in the slave trade of 30,000 to 50,000 Indigenous people in the United States by 1715.202 The practice of enslaving Indigenous people, however, was largely abandoned in the United States by 1720, in part because of militant resistance on the part of Indigenous nations.203 In telling Bibb\u2019s story, we hope to invite consideration of just how complex these histories are, rather than point fingers here or there. Bibb was a fugitive slave who, like so many slaves, was the son of a slave mother and a white father,204 and was likely conceived through the rape of his mother. He had been owned by a First Nations man on colonized land. Bibb escaped when his Indigenous master died, and went on to become a colonizer, purchasing land from the same British Crown that had stolen the land from Indigenous peoples across what\u2019s now called Canada and the United States. He did so to provide safe haven for other escaped slaves. Bibb was a social worker who contributed to founding an organization that helped his community secure basic freedom, education, and security. Bibb\u2019s story illustrates the intensity with which histories of slavery, colonialism, patriarchy, and social work interlock. When this social worker intervened in one political problem that was most pressing for him, he couldn\u2019t help but actively participate in another. Perhaps, in limitless variations, this complexity is the history of social work. Anti-Slavery Societies and Black Immigrant Assistance The earliest Black social work focused largely on assisting people who escaped slavery and fled to Canada, often with no money, no food, and no spare clothing. Rather than imagining this work to be exceptionally \u201cparticular\u201d to Black communities and therefore irrelevant to the subsequent development of social work more generally, we should look on it as work that helped to meet the needs of a group of people who were struggling as a result of unjust social conditions (as can be said of many social workings today and in the past). There was no state assistance for fugitive slaves (with the exception of Black people who emigrated after the War of 1812 and had assisted the British forces, who were given land).205 In response to this socially constituted need, a massive voluntary effort was undertaken to assist escaped slaves, which involved Black and white people collaborating in anti-slavery and liberation societies.206 These groups helped people find jobs, provided food and other resources, and more generally did the work that would later be called social work when undertaken in an organized way within poor white migrant communities. They also crossed national boundaries, just as later professional social work would do;207 for example, the American Anti-Slavery Society sent agents across the border to Canada to assist escaped slaves.208 These organizations fostered an ethos of mutual aid. Many of the people providing and organizing support were escaped slaves who had established themselves in Canada.209 Organizations like the Fugitives\u2019 Home and the Windsor Anti-Slavery Society were founded and run by fugitive slaves determined to assist other fugitives.210 Several were run by Black women, including the Ladies Freedman\u2019s Aid Society, the Ladies Colored Fugitive Association, and the Toronto Ladies\u2019 Association for the Relief of Destitute Colored Fugitives.211 Sharing the sensibility of what would soon be called social work, these organizations often believed that indiscriminate relief was bad and that aid should be restricted and controlled. For instance, the 1853 report of the Canada Anti-Slavery Society says: \u201cAll that able-bodied men and women require is a fair chance, friendly advice, and a little encouragement, perhaps a little assistance at first. Those who are really willing to work can procure employment in a short time after their arrival.\u201d212 While the fugitive relief effort was carried out on a massive scale, individual aid was often restricted, due to prevalent discourses of liberalism, capitalism, and scientific charity. It also bears repeating, yet again, that such relief efforts later run by white people for recent immigrants from Europe is called the origin of social work. Social Services A number of social work and social service projects were organized by members of Black communities in order to assist others in their communities. While some white people were also involved in helping escaped slaves, charitable and social services were segregated in Canada. Edward Lee and Ilyan Ferrer describe \u201csystemic exclusion from white social work institutions\u201d for the Black community.213 They also argue that \u201cthe exclusionary logic of the colour line was reflective of how communities of colour were racially segregated within the Canadian urban geography and provides further explanation as to why they were unable to access the white dominant charity or social settlement movements.\u201d The community building, aid, organizing, and advocacy that Black people did (and continue to do) are very clearly within the realm of what is considered social work, even though it has not been recognized as such in social work history: Elizabeth Jackson Shadd Shreve travelled through Southern Ontario forests to visit sick people and deliver food and clothing to those without;214 and Black people created youth groups, housing cooperatives, and political organizations like the Nova Scotia Association for the Advancement of Coloured People and the National Black Coalition in Nova Scotia.215 Benevolence clubs were also an important site of social service delivery and community building. One of the most prominent was called the True Band Society, which organized to create Black community self-sufficiency.216 The first True Band was founded in Amherstburg, Ontario (near Windsor), in 1854.217 Like the Provincial Union Association founded the same year, it worked to create and support Black community self-sufficiency.218 The True Bands provided resources to poor Black families, provided care for sick people, supported schools, and worked to resolve conflicts among community members.219 By 1856, there were",

Edi\u00e7\u00e3o do Kindle. fourteen True Band organizations with 600 members.220 Both the Provincial Union and the True Bands formed out of critiques about the work of groups like the Refugee Home Society and people like Henry Bibb. They considered the raising of funds and supplies from white people to be shameful, and they wanted Black communities to be self-sufficient. They also opposed the construction of Black settlements, calling for people to integrate into Canadian society. One of the strongest voices against collecting resources (\u201cbegging,\u201d as they called it) was Mary Ann Shadd Cary, who was active in Black community social services and media.221 Black communities also built formal institutions modelled after those imported from Europe through colonialism.222 For example, Nova Scotian orphanages and children\u2019s homes wouldn\u2019t admit Black children \u2013 resulting in them sometimes being put in asylums or on work farms.223 Therefore, under the leadership of James R. Johnston and the African United Baptists Association, the Nova Scotia Home for Coloured Children (NSHCC) opened in 1921.224 Due to systemic racial segregation in social services,225 this institution was incredibly important to the Black community. Its opening marked the largest gathering of Black people in Nova Scotia since 1783.226 The NSHCC is an example of the social work initiatives that Black communities undertook in Canada. Candice Roker discusses the \u201cpositive survival\u201d resistance to racist exclusion of Black people in Nova Scotia. She argues that the creation of the NSHCC \u201cis one of the most public examples of the African Nova Scotian community taking care of its own.\u201d227 The NSHCC retained its historical name but became racially integrated in the 1970s;228 it continued to operate as an orphanage until the late 1980s.229 Like so many institutions that house vulnerable children, including Indian residential schools and many institutions for disabled children,230 significant abuses took place at the NSHCC. In 1948, a social worker documented concerns about inadequate food for the children living in the NSHCC. Sexual abuse was documented in the 1980s, including the rape of a child, but no charges were ever laid.231 In 2001, a number of former residents of the home filed lawsuits for abuse,232 some of which dates back to as early as the 1940s.233 In 2014, the premier of Nova Scotia apologized for the abuse as part of a settlement with survivors, and a restorative inquiry was announced in 2015.234 Terrible things happened at this institution that should never happen to anyone. It is entirely possible abuse was present there from its early days. Yet, even then, we can hold this injustice in tension with an acknowledgment of the importance of what the Nova Scotian Black community did by building the home. Building a racially segregated institution, which seems to have been characterized by the same abuses of power as were found at other institutional sites, can be conceptualized as yet another instance of navigating the norms that were available at the time. Black Nova Scotians built for their community\u2019s children a resource often considered at that time indispensable for serving children in need. As in so many other institutions, many children were seriously harmed within its walls. There is frequently a tendency to view historical developments as either good or bad, but removing the NSHCC from \u201cgood\u201d anti-racist history and placing it into \u201cbad\u201d institutional history prevents us from struggling to cultivate a complex relationship with this fundamentally interlocking history and its legacies. Black communities navigated available norms, but didn\u2019t adopt all available norms. As a glaring example with tremendous relevance to contemporary social work, we found no historical record of any Black community in the United States or Canada establishing a child protection agency in which people from outside a family or community scrutinized parents and determined whether a child would be allowed to remain with them. In the extensive social welfare systems created by Black folks in Canada and the United States, we found no evidence of a single Black agency that practised involuntary child apprehension. White child protection agencies didn\u2019t normally* serve Black families until the end of legal racial segregation in the mid-twentieth century. Yet, even in cities with significant Black social welfare infrastructures, including women\u2019s clubs, settlement houses, and orphanages, it seems that no Black community practised child apprehension. (If we\u2019re wrong and one or two communities did so, it would have been extremely marginal considering that we\u2019ve encountered no trace of it.) Black and white social workers learned from one another and often worked together, developing similar (usually racially segregated) services, but Black social workers didn\u2019t practice child apprehension. In the only article we found exploring the fact that professional child welfare didn\u2019t operate in US Black communities until after legal racial segregation was abolished,\u2020 Jillian Jimenez writes: \u201cA shadow child welfare system [existed] that performed similar functions to the public child welfare system from which African American children were largely excluded.\u201d235 In apparently every Black community, people were left to do the work of \u201cchild protection\u201d and \u201cchild welfare\u201d using means that had been available to them before anybody had ever become a paid \u201csocial worker.\u201d In a recent interview about having won the Woman of Distinction Award, Black Canadian politician Zanana Akande was asked where her ethic of \u201ccontinuing to push\u201d for justice originated. In her answer, she described the informal \u201csocial workers who weren\u2019t social workers\u201d who collectively raised her when she was growing up in downtown Toronto in the 1940s and \u201950s: \u201cThat [ethic] comes from where I was born and the people around me \u2013 the first social workers who weren\u2019t social workers, because we were all raised collectively by our parents and by anyone else who happened to walk down the street and see us \u2013 that you must speak out, you must take care of each other, and you must push for what you want.\u201d236 In Black communities prior to the end of racial segregation and the introduction of child protective agencies into Black communities, practices, norms, and mores were in place to protect children from violence, respond to tragedies such as parental death, and so on. \u201cChildren routinely lived with grandparents not only in the case of death, but when one or both parents left the local area to look for work \u2026 [and] children with no family would be taken in by unrelated adults in the neighbourhood who did not have children.\u201d237 Resonant practices have existed in all communities at all times, varying significantly from place to place. Jimenez traces these specific Black child welfare practices to West African traditions of extended kinship and communal care for children, as well as to strategies later developed in response to the violences of slavery \u2013 in which Black children and adults were kidnapped, forcibly separated from one another, and held as white people\u2019s property. In the first half of the twentieth century in Black communities in the United States, the principal strategy for protecting children from abuse and neglect was community surveillance: \u201cthe extended family, especially grandmothers \u2026 aunts, great aunts, and older sisters \u2026 provided a concentric circle of approval and disapproval to support or criticize the child rearing practices of a child\u2019s primary caretakers.\u201d238 There were community-sanctioned interventions for when adults harmed children, which were rooted in community-specific hierarchies of moral and political authority. Older women relatives in Black America occupied the role only then being taken over in white America by paid ruling class strangers. One practice is a violent imposition, and the other assumes communities are capable of healing and protecting themselves; both are specific and situated means of social working to keep children safe from abuse and neglect. A very different child protection system would be in place today if families and communities were imagined capable of protecting and caring for their own children, rather than assuming the state and its professionals must do so. As a consequence of racist laws and mores, Black families were fortunate to rarely have their children apprehended by state authorities during the first half of the twentieth century. Instead, they carried on and internally adapted long-standing traditions of child protection and care. The earliest white child protection agencies were born at a time of normalized extreme anti-Black violence. Black childrearing practices at the time therefore explicitly sought to prevent children from exposing themselves to the normative violences of white supremacy;239 we can imagine the devastation that might have resulted had Black families become targeted by white social work. Black families worked to protect Black children from abusive parents and also from white supremacy. Their efforts were central to Black child protection during a time of widespread lynching and other explicit anti-Black violence. Such child protection isn\u2019t normatively validated as \u201csocial work.\u201d Of all the diverse and significant Black interventions into the social world for over a century, from slavery liberation societies through to the civil rights movement of the mid-twentieth century, there seems to have been a consensus that the approach to \u201cchild protection\u201d taken for granted among white ruling classes wasn\u2019t morally or politically acceptable. No matter how one is positioned in relation to these histories, this wholesale rejection is an astounding fact for us all to seriously reflect upon today. Class Stratification and How It Interlocked with Racism and Social Work As with white social workers, Black social workers in the United States and Canada tended to be upper or middle class people assisting poor people. Class divisions among Black people, however, had different effects and significance from those among white people, given that segregation and racism had a levelling effect on Black communities. No matter how much money you had, you often could not live in a ruling class neighbourhood if you were Black, nor was it easy to get a loan, be free from the threat of racist violence, go many places, or do many other things available to white people. Class status did not inoculate against racism. Carlton-LaNey writes, \u201cThere was very little physical, social and economic distance\u201d between those doing early Black social work and others in the communities where they worked. They \u201clived in the same communities and by virtue of race shared many of the same societal problems and issues of concern.\u201d However, those \u201cwho engaged in the emerging social work profession were among the \u2026 educated elite of the African American community.\u201d240 Educated Black women primarily provided social services,241 which could have perpetuated white ruling class social mores. Yet, Carlton-LaNey asserts that \u201clower class women were also active in clubs and formed organizations in an effort to serve themselves and the needy in their communities.\u201d242 She writes that this class diversity among workers, as well as shared experiences of racism, helped these social workers more reflexively consider their own power: even educated Black social workers with \u201cproperty ownership, poise, and eloquence \u2026 [were often] treated like \u2018washerwomen\u2019 [which] \u2026 kept them attuned to the deplorable conditions to which their less-fortunate sisters were subjected.\u201d243 Through to the 1920s, \u201ca white woman in Halifax looking for help with her laundry felt free to stop any African-Nova Scotian woman on the street and request \u2018where she could get a good girl.\u2019\u201d244 White supremacy served to homogenize Blackness so that, in practice, it was the only relevant identifier in many cases, or at least it was the identity category that trumped all others. The assumption that any Black person would know where to get a cleaner in Halifax was based on the pervasive white supremacist association of Black people with domestic service and dirt. This thinking had important social significance and was intimately tied up with interlocking moral economies of human value. At this time, eugenics was often referred to as \u201cmental hygiene,\u201d245 and Ivory Soap boasted about its ability to \u201ccivilize\u201d Indigenous people.246 This period was also the era in which white ruling class women acquired an unprecedented degree of exalted bourgeois subjectivity. Fellows and Razack explain that dirt was important in constituting these select women as separate and distinct from \u2013 and to imagine themselves morally superior to \u2013 \u201cwasherwomen.\u201d247 The renegotiation of white ruling class women\u2019s positioning within largely unchanged moral economies of human value relied on the intensive and ongoing discursive denigration of others. Remaining racially devalued even with upward class mobility, Black social workers\u2019 experiences of continued discrimination, alongside the relative class diversity among Black service providers, seems to have mitigated the classism normally inherent to social work. Most Black women welfare reformers, according to Gordon, \u201cwere usually newly middle-class, perhaps a generation away from slavery and without much cushion against economic misfortune.\u201d248 These women were living a very different experience of being middle class than that of their white contemporaries.\n\nChapman, Chris; Withers, A.J..

However, other scholars cite historical evidence of overt and insidious classism among Black social workers too. Many of the class biases that existed in the work of friendly visitors and other white charity work were also present among Black social work organizations. For example, urban Northern social workers who provided social services to migrants from the South often looked down upon the people they were trying to help. Martin and Martin say that Black social workers, like other urban Northern Americans, perceived the migrants as \u201cuncouth, unkempt, boisterous, and ignorant.\u201d253 Northern urban social workers, Black and white, therefore engaged in what Sheila Weiss calls an \u201ceffort of the middle class to mold the behavior of the migrants in its own image [which] was clearly a one-way process. There was never any hint that the black bourgeoisie had anything to learn from its newly arrived neighbors.\u201d254 Like many other well-meaning people working to affect social change, then and now, early Black social workers often seem to have believed they knew what was best for the people they worked with. But their ideas were often informed by classist moral economies. This classed outlook was evident, for example, when Black professor R.L. Smith of Oakwood, Texas, began community organizing to make his community more aesthetically pleasing in 1889.255 As a ruling class man, he understood the physical appearance of the village to be its most pressing need. It was only after a year, when only minor issues had been resolved and people didn\u2019t follow through on more major and expensive undertakings, that he began to wonder why the response had been so lukewarm. He realized it was because the people he was working with were poor. He concluded that \u201cwhat the Negro farmers of Texas and of the South really needed was not, at this stage, a Village Improvement Society.\u201d256 If Smith had facilitated a conversation about what the community needed and how it should go about achieving those needs at the initial meeting a year earlier, their efforts may have been much more productive. Having largely done nothing for the first year, Smith now set out to reduce poverty, alongside his own aim of getting people to improve their homes and yards. He helped organize a cooperative in which farmers in the area pooled their resources, enabling two important changes: buying in bulk (obtaining discounts for volume purchases) and avoiding the use of credit, which could mean substantial savings in interest payments. After the organization had been somewhat successful in helping farmers gain financial security, an organization called the Negro Cooperative Society was founded. Smith was a supporter of the Booker T. Washington \u2013 or liberal, rather than radical \u2013 school of Black activism, and he tied the ranks in the organization to how much people had saved. Only once someone achieved the twelfth degree, and was thus named \u201cGrand Patriarch,\u201d did they gain a vote at conference.257 The richest members of the cooperative society were granted exclusive voting rights, enabling them to direct the society regardless of support from its majority. Class hierarchy and bias drove this organizational design in a clear illustration of the material effects of moral economy: those already regarded superior tend to accumulate further moral (and thus political) capital. It\u2019s assumed that those who have saved the most money are most deserving and will know best. From there, a structure is built that allows those with the most political and moral capital to gain even more institutional political power \u2013 even in this \u201ccooperative.\u201d Indeed, a large cross-section of Black social workers supported Booker T. Washington\u2019s principles, which \u201cmeasure success by the ownership of land, homes, businesses, union membership, and bank accounts.\u201d258 The class status of most Black social workers, like most social workers in general, informed their values and understandings of the world. According to Peebles-Wilkins and Francis, \u201cThese women\u2019s ideals were [ruling class] American ideals.\u201d259 They accepted the dominant views of society, working to reform some systems of oppression while leaving others intact \u2013 especially capitalism. Peebles-Wilkins and Francis suggest that Black upwardly mobile social workers, such as Mary Church Terrell, \u201cespoused fundamental, traditional American values about family, the work ethic, social obligations, democracy, and freedom that she transmitted cross-culturally.\u201d They write: \u201cThe goals of black women activists focused on uplift and contained the overtones of social Darwinism,\u201d which was the assumed social good of unimpeded competition within existing social and political structures.260 Many Black social workers, like white ones, upheld capitalism, which, after all, was the economic system permitting their upward mobility. They worked towards cumulative individual racial uplift within the parameters of existing economic and moral systems, rather than working to overhaul the system for the benefit of those suffering the most from it. Many social workers, informed by liberal individualism and prevalent moral economies of race and class differentiation, directed their change efforts at individuals rather than the social structures that caused such differentiation. Cornelius Bynum reports that \u201cAfrican American elites largely accommodated white racist assumptions about black inferiority.\u201d261 Martin and Martin suggest that established residents of the urban North \u201cfeared that the newcomers would reinforce stereotypes of black people and stir up antiblack sentiments that would have dire consequences for all black people.\u201d262 While social workers worked to \u201chelp\u201d poor people, they also often worked to normalize and assimilate members of the Black community so that \u2013 like white ruling class women \u2013 they too might gain what Fellows and Razack call a toehold on respectability.263 When social workers did explicitly set out to address systemic issues, they became burnt out, claim Martin and Martin. As a result, in the end, \u201cthey focused their attention on trying to change the character of the victims of the dominant system, helping them to cope better with their oppression.\u201d264 Social work interventions were frequently about normalizing poor Black people and getting them to conform to middle class behaviours, aesthetics, and values.265 This form of social work involved many of the same interventions that the friendly visitors stressed: cleanliness, good housekeeping, temperance, thrift, and so on. The 1921 report of Cincinnati\u2019s Negro Civic Welfare Committee of the Council of Social Agencies demonstrates that the committee was incredibly condescending and paternalistic towards working class people and enacted capitalist indoctrination. The committee operated a workplace friendly visiting program involving over 800 Black women. \u201cShe goes and gives friendly advice on punctuality, regularity, efficiency, thrift, and tries to develop in them the proper attitude toward their work.\u201d266 This committee may well have advocated for workers, and the citation above may have been written to attract donations. Yet, the report depicts this social work organization as working to improve people\u2019s lives by helping them transform into more productive capitalist subjects, something that did nothing to improve the institutionalized social, economic, political, and moral barriers they experienced. We\u2019re not saying that any of the work of early Black social workers shouldn\u2019t have been done. Rather, we can all uniquely interrogate the complexities of the past in order to better understand and interrupt patterns we may continue to replicate, uniquely positioned as each one of us is within these legacies. As bell hooks says, \u201cInterlocking systems [of oppression] indict us all in some way.\u201d267 Early Women Social Workers and Gender Roles Working to ameliorate some of the harshness caused by capitalism while upholding the system itself is similar to how many early women social workers \u2013 Black and white \u2013 approached gender. Separate spheres discourse was incredibly oppressive for women. Yet, its specific contours and divisions also created possibilities for women to take up leadership roles in what came to be called social work. Women encroached into public spaces by intervening into others\u2019 private spheres. As is true of all communities, Black women responded to gendered expectations in diverse ways. Mary Church Terrell, the honorary lifetime president of the National Association of Colored Women (NACW), largely supported separate spheres.268 However, Maggie Walker was adamantly and publicly opposed to separate spheres. Writing in 1912, she argued: \u201cThere is neither justice or good common sense in the demand that every woman should confine her activities to the domestic duties of home . . . As ability, adaptability decide these things for men, so let them decide for woman.\u201d269 Walker, the first woman bank president in the United States, supported equal rights for women, which included for her the abolition of the mores of gendered separate spheres. Furthermore, regardless of their own navigation of separate spheres, many early Black social workers advocated for suffrage and gender equality,* including Mary Ann Shadd Cary,270 Mary Church Terrell, Ida B. Wells-Barnett,271 and Maggie Walker.272 Women exposed themselves to the risks of men\u2019s patriarchal moralizing when they became active in the public sphere. For example, Henry Bibb said of Mary Ann Shadd Cary\u2019s disagreement with him about how the community should fund a school that her outspokenness \u201cwill add nothing to her credit as a lady.\u201d273 Yee explains: \u201c[W]hile Black women\u2019s participation in community-building may have been considered an acceptable extension of women\u2019s domestic responsibility beyond the private household, those who did so found themselves in a delicate balancing act.\u201d274 If Black women social workers were too outspoken, their femininity and precarious toehold on respectability could be questioned \u2013 within a patriarchal understanding in which femininity and outspokenness were antithetical. Subjugated Community-Based Social Workings Beyond Black and White The relatively large number of Black people in what\u2019s now called Canada and the United States up to the periods we\u2019re discussing is a direct result of the transatlantic slave trade. The relatively small number of migrants from Asia and other parts of the world \u2013 through to the 1960s \u2013 is a direct result of exclusionary racist immigration policies. Due to these two white supremacist practices, there were many more Black people in what\u2019s now called the United States and Canada than any other racialized groups from the Global South. However, some people from Asia and other parts of the world did migrate here. As in Black and white communities, these communities also came together in new ways to meet needs that resulted from the massive demographic shifts occurring. Most of these communities\u2019 efforts have not been as extensively documented as those in white and Black communities, making tracing their histories difficult; but this scarce documentation doesn\u2019t mean they weren\u2019t actively involved in the diverse activities of social working. Some research exists on the Chinese community in British Columbia (BC). During the era when professional social work was born, Chinese folks in BC \u201corganiz[ed] a remarkable number of voluntary mutual aid fraternal associations, partly in response to the racial discrimination they suffered,\u201d beginning soon after they first arrived in Canada in the late 1850s.275 These groups organized to fight racism, provide social services within their own community, and facilitate conflict resolution. Mutual aid groups operated in Chinese communities in BC for about a century, and were integral to the community in the face of the tremendous racist hostilities that surrounded them.276 Around the same time, the Sikh community in BC worked collectively with other South Asians to provide food, housing, and jobs for those in need; lobby the government; and fight discrimination. Today, we would call this collection of activities \u201cnewcomer settlement social work,\u201d and it\u2019s basically exactly what white and Black social workers were providing and calling social work at the time. In 1907, the Vancouver Khalsa Diwan Society was established as a Sikh religious organizing body, but, according to Norman Buchignani, Doreen Indra, and Ram Srivastava, it \u201cquickly involved itself in matters of general [South Asian] community welfare and became the focal point for subsequent South Asian battles against discrimination.\u201d277 While the initial group was Sikh, it is said to have \u201cspoke[n] for all South Asian\n\nChapman, Chris; Withers, A.J.. A Violent History of Benevolence: Interlocking Oppression in the Moral Economies of Social Working (pp. 115-120). University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division. Edi\u00e7\u00e3o do Kindle. Canadians regardless of religion.\u201d278 Because of this inclusivity, \u201cSouth Asian Muslims and Hindus \u2026 contributed money and labour to building the Vancouver Sikh temple, for they saw it as a secular rallying point for everyone from \u2018Hindustan.\u2019\u201d279 Together, they organized against British imperial rule in South Asia and Canadian government plans to deport South Asians.280 \u201cOver the next ten years South Asians battled continuously against racial subordination. In the process they developed a set of community institutions that were remarkable given the circumstances.\u201d281 Diverse Indigenous nations and communities were also actively social working throughout this period. Folks drew on long-standing traditions of mutual aid and resisted the ongoing colonial project, which specifically aimed at displacing cultural practices of sharing and helping by imposing capitalist economic systems onto Indigenous nations. In these circumstances, working against colonialism to fight assimilation and preserve traditions of helping were important interventions into the social world.282 Other Indigenous interventions into the social world at the time, which fall outside the standard account of social work history, are the many ways that parents, elders, and community members organized to prevent their children from being apprehended by the state and tried to incite change when they heard about the abuse their children were subjected to.283 The centrality of the conflict between Richmond and Addams has become standard in envisioning what social work was, is, and can be. Yet, situating the conflict between the \u201cchild protection\u201d efforts of Indigenous families, on the one hand, and the \u201cchild protection\u201d work of Indian residential schools and children\u2019s aid societies, on the other hand, as another way of thinking about the parameters and possibilities of social work would open up very different understandings of what \u201csocial work\u201d is and can be. Recently, Indigenous practices such as restorative justice are beginning to be incorporated into contemporary professional social work.284 But, as we make such much-needed changes, we should be careful to avoid telling accounts of social work history that minimize the violence with which such practices have been \u2013 and continue to be \u2013 displaced and supplanted with traditions and practices from Europe and white settler communities. Recognition of that violent suppression is part of the work of decolonization too. We also need to be cautious about exactly how Indigenous practices and traditions get incorporated. As Chris has written of their work in a colonial and disablist institution that \u201cincorporated the medicine wheel and a talking feather into our life-skills curricula,\u201d these inclusions were never permitted to interfere with institutional efficiency and violence. They \u201cwere removed from their original contexts and pasted into our institutional one, redeployed in such a way as to extend the status quo operations of institutionalization and enculturation.\u201d285 Indigenous practices can be significant in the shift towards more just and dignified possible ways for humans to come together in what is called social work,286 as can the work of countless other communities that have had their practices displaced, marginalized, and subjugated by professional social work. However, these practices should never be cut and pasted into otherwise unchanged white social work. Rather, we need to fundamentally transform the narrow and hierarchical norms and mores that are now institutionalized. The history we provide in this chapter is nowhere near complete. The diversity of examples of social work that sprang up in response to specific community concerns around the turn of the last century exceeds the number of communities that existed at the time. Social work in distinct communities looked different from one another because those communities, and their beliefs, needs, and resources, were different from one another. Such diversity \u2013 then and now \u2013 could function as an important resource for social workers today, but only if we know to look for it at all. Conclusion We have given a brief overview of early social work in the United States and Canada, focusing on Black social work because of the existing scholarship on the breadth of activities and the obvious erasures of sometimes identical activities as those included within white social work history. Presumably, like the majority of those in the helping professions today, most Black social workers at the time worked largely out of the public eye, and so their contributions will forever remain unknown to history. Community organizing and social movements are made up of many people who all make important contributions, but when these activities are recorded in history, the collectivities get translated through individualism into remarkable heroes who bravely led the way.287 This tendency alone, though, doesn\u2019t account for why so little is known within social work scholarship about Black community and social service work a century ago. Many Black leaders \u2013 such as Wells, Du Bois, and Walker \u2013 were famous around 1900 for their many interventions into the social world. And, of course, we\u2019ve clearly left countless other well-known Black figures out of this history. It\u2019s simply untrue that social work emerged only out of British and white settler efforts, as the standard account would have it. Yet, that false history continues to have concrete effects today. Because the standard account is told the way it is, radical social work scholar Mimi Abramovitz can critique that, due to \u201cracism and segregation, the settlements and the networks established by African American women never became well known or exercised much influence outside the African American community.\u201d288 While this assessment is not entirely untrue, it erases what influence they did have and the prominence some historical Black folks held, and it doesn\u2019t consider whether white folks like Addams might have been directly influenced by the sometimes earlier Black efforts. Yet, what is perhaps even more troubling is that Abramovitz can acknowledge the influence of racism and still also write, as a summary of \u201cthe history of social work,\u201d that the \u201csocial change-oriented Settlement House Movement (SHM) vied for control of the emerging profession with the older and more individually oriented Charity Organization Society (COS). This initial conflict \u2026 anticipated a century of struggle.\u201d289 We are struck by the incongruity of adding the fact that racism shaped history to that very tradition of history without reshaping the priorities which inform its telling as a result of this fact. Social work struggles with personal versus political change, certainly, but why should that particular conflict be the guiding framework for all social work history? Or why should that struggle be represented by the COS versus white settlements? Another history of social work could present the primary tension as that of the liberal Booker T. Washington camp versus the radical W.E.B. Du Bois camp, or the liberal Maggie Walker camp versus the radical Ida B. Wells camp. Like centring the conflict between Richmond and Addams, these framings would describe the tension between advocating for reform within a largely unchanged system versus working to fundamentally transform the system. Even more transformative, as suggested earlier, would be if we honoured the \u201cchild protection\u201d work done in Black communities with no institutionalized child protective services, alongside that done in Indigenous communities struggling to save their children from externally imposed professional \u201cprotection,\u201d and we took such widely diverse work as a counterpoint to the work that became institutionalized as white child protective services and Indian residential schooling. This ongoing struggle of communities taking care of their own versus external imposition is a fundamental tension that has always existed in \u201csocial work practice\u201d \u2013 and honouring or centring it might significantly shift the ways we think and feel about what we do. Maybe it would even transform what we tend to do. In their history of what they call \u201cradical social work,\u201d Michael Reisch and Janice Andrews discuss some of the work of Black organizers during the Progressive Era. However, they repeatedly make white people the reference point. For example, they write: \u201cSome early radical social workers were far more willing than their mainstream counterparts to work cooperatively with people of color and to participate in inter-racial organizations or multiracial coalitions.\u201d290 Here, the category \u201cradical social workers\u201d is represented as white. They go on to mention the work of (unnamed) Black women organizers and then emphasize Jane Addams\u2019s role in anti-racist organizing. Such representations continue to inform imaginaries of who (radical) social workers are today. While American histories of Black social work are much more concrete and accessible than Canadian ones,291 plenty of interventions into the social world in 1800s Black Ontario and Nova Scotia are well documented. These stories are not entirely hidden \u2013 the work of anti-slavery societies and Black colonizers are often disseminated during Black History Month. The opening of the Nova Scotia Home for Coloured Children brought out the biggest gathering of Black Nova Scotians in over a century,292 and one of its founders, James Johnston, had the largest funeral in Halifax since the death of Sir John S.D. Thompson, Canada\u2019s fourth prime minister, two decades earlier.293 These events were not marginal. How do they become and remain marginal stories when history gets written? Black social workers were clearly influenced by what was going on in white social work.294 Without a doubt, that\u2019s true. But white social workers were also influenced by Black social workers,295 and this reciprocity isn\u2019t acknowledged in the standard account. Most of the histories of Black social work we\u2019ve drawn upon make mention of white social work, especially of Jane Addams and her work.296 Racialized social work authors are required to demonstrate their fluency in white social work history, but white social work historians don\u2019t need to prove their credentials in relation to Black histories or any other histories outside of white settler and European communities. This double standard is due to the moral economy of white supremacy continuing to shape what gets known and done. Discussing Black social work educator and social worker George Haynes\u2019s view that Black social workers needed to learn Black history, Martin and Martin write that Haynes felt Black people are \u201cboth creatures and creators of history in that history has placed them where they are right now and has shaped their point of view, their identity, and their aspirations.\u201d297 This description is particularly true of Black people in the context of white supremacist American and Canadian history, but it can also be said to be true in site-specific ways for all of us. We are all \u201ccreatures and creators of history\u201d; history shapes what we can think, perceive, feel, do, and be \u2013 not only because of which past events occurred, but also because of which past events get told, how they\u2019re framed, from whose perspective they\u2019re told, and who gets represented as significant in their development. The exclusion of Black and racialized social workers from the standard account of social work history is a product of white supremacy, and it replicates social work as a white institution, naturalizing white people in the role of social worker and making social workers of colour seem aberrational even today. Histories centre certain figures and decentre others. Addams, a white woman, is centred while Wells and Walker are decentred. This act of narrative exaltation and marginalization has real consequences. Consider the following: Karen Lundblad writes, \u201cAs a social reformer and organizer, Addams is almost unparalleled \u2026 [and] remains an inspiration and role model for social workers today.\u201d298 We admire Addams for her work and her mind. She is indeed an inspiration. Yet, what does it mean to frame her as \u201calmost unparalleled\u201d if we consider the Black women who fought for social change, benefited their communities, and contributed to the helping professions as a whole? Further salt is added to the wound when claims of Addams\u2019s uniqueness are evidenced by her relationship with Wells, Du Bois, and other Black activists. What\u2019s forgotten is that she gravitated to them as inspirational, at the very same time as they gravitated to her. She wasn\u2019t the only inspiration in those relationships. And she doesn\u2019t have to be the only one available to us today.

Of the uneven relationship at the time between anti-Black lynching and disablist eugenics, one illustrative event was the murder of a \u201cseventeen year old boy by the name of Jesse Washington \u2026 in 1916,\u201d which is the year after the cornerstone eugenic criminology text, The Criminal Imbecile, was published.108 James Allen says that Jesse Washington was \u201cseriously mentally challenged. The wife of the farmer he worked for was found dead.\u201d109 Jesse was tried and convicted. From Rafter\u2019s history of eugenic criminology, we might expect that Jesse would have been given an indefinite prison sentence, resulting in a eugenically rationalized lifelong incarceration due to his intellectual disability \u2013 although in Texas, where he was killed, he may have been more likely confined to an asylum for his life. Regardless, neither of these things took place. Instead he was dragged out of the courtroom, kicked down the steps, tortured, burned alive, castrated, had his fingers cut off one by one, and hanged. \u201cThere were 16,000 people crowding the street to watch this boy be tortured \u2026 [T]here were cheers, like at a football game, cheering the torturers on.\u201d Perhaps Jesse was partly targeted because he was disabled, but he was publicly tortured and murdered because he was Black.110 Ida B. Wells-Barnett Black communities fought vigorously to abolish lynching. One of the most prominent anti-lynching activists was Ida B. Wells (Wells-Barnett,\u2020 following her marriage).111 She was also a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the National Association of Colored Women, and was active in the women\u2019s club movement. In 1884, she first gained wide recognition for refusing to move from an all-white train car and for winning a settlement against the railroad.112 Wells wrote a condemnation of lynching in Memphis\u2019s Free Speech and Headlight after her friend Tom Moss was lynched for defending himself from white men\u2019s physical attacks in 1892. Due to the response to this condemnation, she was forced to flee the South. She recalls: \u201cIt was for the assertion of this fact, in the defense of her own race, that the writer hereof became an exile; her property destroyed and her return to her home forbidden under penalty of death.\u201d113 Nevertheless, she continued to agitate against lynching. In 1899, she wrote and circulated a pamphlet, \u201cLynch Law in Georgia,\u201d to Black communities in Chicago. She wrote: \u201cThe real purpose of the savage demonstrations is to teach the Negro that in the south he has no rights that the law will enforce. Samuel House was burned to teach the Negroes that no matter what a white man does to them, they must not resist.\u201d114 In response to dominant framings of anti-Black lynching more generally, and specifically to Jane Addams\u2019s acceptance of this normative white framing in her own condemnation of lynching, Wells demonstrated that most lynchings didn\u2019t involve even a claim* that the murdered man had raped a white woman.115 She showed that many of the lynchings committed on the grounds of sexual assault by Black men against white women were actually white responses to consensual interracial relationships, which were considered unacceptable within interlocking white supremacist patriarchal moral economies.116 White men had only recently lost unmitigated sexual access to the Black women they owned in law, regardless of these women\u2019s desires and consent, with the end of slavery.117 The predominant white account of lynching at the time was that white women were regularly raped by Black men, but Andrea Smith challenges the fictitiousness of this narrative: \u201cIn fact, Black women needed protection from white men.\u201d118 Indeed, Wells-Barnett\u2019s grandmother was a slave and her father a slave-owner\u2019s son \u2013 so he was likely a child who resulted from rape, as was common during slavery.119 Although fictitious, the prevalent notion that white men had to lynch Black men in order to save white women from Black rape was so pervasive that Hollywood\u2019s first blockbuster, The Birth of a Nation, which had the highest grossing ticket sales until Gone with the Wind twenty-four years later,120 depicts what claims to be a historical account of post-Civil War reconstruction and glorifies the founding of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) and a lynching in response to a Black man raping a white woman.121 When considering the views of Smith and Wells-Barnett on lynching Black men accused of raping white women, it\u2019s important to note that white men who raped any woman of any race were never lynched. In fact, most often there was no consequence at all. Contemporary readers should remember this point if they find Wells-Barnett\u2019s handling of rape and sexual assault accusations troubling due to having been socialized within second wave feminism\u2019s crucial politicization of sexual assault and the importance of believing those who say they\u2019ve been sexually assaulted. That indispensable lesson needs to be taken into account, alongside a concern about white supremacist framings of Black and racialized men as particularly prone to rape and other patriarchal violence. Of course, even consensual relationships can involve sexual assault \u2013 a point which could be said to become lost within Wells-Barnett\u2019s claim that the issue pertains to race and not sexual assault as the (interracial) relationship was consensual. (That, said, it was not until the 1970s in the United States122 and in 1983 in Canada123 that men could be held legally responsible for raping their wives.) However, it doesn\u2019t appear Wells-Barnett believed that rape never happened. But she was fighting against the ruse by which rape (real or fictitious) was used to excuse lynching. Like many other Black feminists, Wells-Barnett understood how gender and race interlocked, and she fought against this interlocking oppression rather than against racism or sexism in isolation. Carlton-LaNey writes of such anti-lynching work, saying that Black women at the time \u201crecognize[d] the political nature of sexism long before their white counterparts.\u201d Wells-Barnett and other early Black social workers \u201cfaced the fact that sexual exploitation and violence were perpetuated by both African American and white men.\u201d Carlton-LaNey therefore argues that \u201cpoliticizing sexual exploitation and harassment for African American women placed it squarely within the context of race. Combatting sexual exploitation, therefore, was inextricably linked to race uplift.\u201d124 Early anti-racist feminism did not minimize sexism or sexual assault; rather, it politicized sexism, sexual assault, and responses to them in multiple directions. Andrea Smith begins her chapter \u201cSexual Violence as a Tool of Genocide\u201d by troubling Susan Brownmiller\u2019s second wave white feminist assertion that rape \u201cis nothing more or less than a conscious process of intimidation by which all men keep all women in a state of fear.\u201d Smith uses this statement as a springboard to explore how racism and colonialism shape the particulars of what rape is.125 Likewise, Wells-Barnett was centrally concerned with situating rape and rape discourse within what contemporary feminists call interlocking oppression, as evidenced by her repeated discussions of gender and race and, to a lesser extent, class.126 Such early anti-racist feminist understandings of interlocking oppression trouble the common history of feminism in which interlocking analyses are a recent development initiated by Black feminists such as the Combahee River Collective,127 Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw,128 Patricia Hill Collins,129 Angela Davis,130 Audre Lorde,131 and bell hooks.132 Without minimizing the importance of Black feminism since the 1970s (which often honours earlier Black feminist history), the Black feminist struggle to work against interlocking oppression goes back to the first wave of feminism, which is largely left out of white histories of feminism. It\u2019s not that we wish to reduce the importance of recent anti-racist feminist authors and activists; it\u2019s that remembering the earlier anti-racist feminists raises troubling questions about how feminism\u2019s history up to the 1970s came to be recorded as yet another white history. After fleeing the South, Wells-Barnett organized anti-lynching organizations in a number of states.133 These and other anti-lynching campaigns were hugely influential in Black communities in the United States. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) emerged from anti-lynching activists. Founded in 1909 by a mixture of some of the Black community organizers we\u2019re discussing in this chapter \u2013 Wells-Barnett, Terrell, and Du Bois \u2013 and some white activists (including Addams), the NAACP has worked for racial equality for over a century and is still active today.134 White Social Work and Anti-Lynching Addams and Wells-Barnett were contemporaries and allies in numerous political struggles.135 Although Addams was somewhat exceptional (for a white person) for her commitment to anti-racism, including her activism against lynching, she also accepted that aspects of the white supremacist connection between sexual assault and lynching were true. She was a member of the NAACP at the time, yet she felt entitled to do and say things that appear to have been unaccountable to the experiences of Black communities. According to Wilma Peebles-Wilkins and E. Aracelis Francis, Addams \u201cdid not seem to understand that lynchings involved innocent victims and were not just an unacceptable response to crime.\u201d136 Addams accepted the view that Black men posed a threat to white women and white communities, but objected to lynchings on the grounds that they were not an effective deterrent to this kind of violence and punishment for crimes should be left to the legal system. She also wrote that lynchings were effective in reducing crimes committed by Black men because \u201ccertain elements of the self can be prevented from coming into action,\u201d but pointed out that this inhibition was only a temporary fix because these \u201celements of the self\u201d might resurface.137 Addams\u2019s analysis was shaped by her whiteness and her class positioning, by moral economies of white supremacy, and by discourses stressing the importance of the rule of law and Black men\u2019s criminality. Like Addams, Willard of the WCTU also didn\u2019t understand that lynching was used to control and terrorize Black people. The WCTU refused to allow Wells to address its annual national assembly in 1893. The following year, Wells secured the sponsorship of an organization to ensure that she could address the meeting. She wanted to confront the WCTU\u2019s failure to publicly condemn the lynching of Black men.138 Wells\u2019s insistence on confronting Willard and the WCTU was provoked by an 1890 interview in which Willard made several racist comments about Black people. Willard\u2019s remarks included reiterating the notion that Black men pose a threat to the safety of women and children. She said of white Southerners: \u201cThe problem in their hands is immeasurable. The colored race multiplies like the locusts of Egypt. The grog-shop [liquor store] is a center of power. The safety of women, of childhood, of the home is menaced.\u201d139 Willard thus reiterated the frequent justification of lynching due to the supposed threat that Black men posed to white women. It is particularly concerning that one of the earliest organizations combatting violence against women reified the idea that Black men were exceptionally violent towards women and failed to condemn the racist violence of lynching. When Wells identified Willard\u2019s position as untrue and racist, Willard defended her position. However, she added: I wish I had said then, as I do now, that the immoralities of white men in their relations with colored women are the source of intolerable race prejudice and hatred, and that there is not a more withering curse upon the manhood of any nation than that which the eternal laws of nature visited upon those men in those homes in which the helpless bondwoman was made the victim of her master\u2019s base desire.140 While Willard continued to claim that Black men posed a sexual threat to white women and girls, she attempted to soften her claims with the acknowledgment that white men also posed a threat to Black women and girls. But, as Mattingly observes, Willard\u2019s condemnation of white men was \u201csituated primarily in the past and associated with the evils of slavery.\u201d141 In effect, Willard was saying that white men may have once posed a threat to Black women and girls, but now it is only Black men who are still dangerous. In response to building pressure, including the condemnation of the WCTU by other prominent Black social justice organizers, the WCTU passed a resolution against lynching in 1895. The resolution stated defensively that the WCTU \u201cought never to have been placed in the position of having to defend themselves from the charge that they favored the lynching of any human being, anywhere, under any circumstances.\u201d142 It also claimed that people \u201cmisrepresented our position,\u201d likely referring to Wells, Ransom, and others who demanded that the WCTU actively and publicly condemn lynching. Coming across this story from about 120 years ago, we recognize the still all-too-familiar pattern within social justice work\n\nChapman, Chris; Withers, A.J.. A Violent History of Benevolence: Interlocking Oppression in the Moral Economies of Social Working (pp. 096-101). University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division. Edi\u00e7\u00e3o do Kindle. and beyond. Rather than deeply reflecting on her position, this white person in a leadership position, and the organization under her direction, dug in their heels and refused to acknowledge the harm they\u2019d caused. The white people thus claimed their own innocence143 and, worse still, depicted themselves as wronged for having been accused of racism. The implication is that the Black community organizers who challenged the organization\u2019s position were overreacting, too sensitive, and too angry \u2013 all of which reaffirms white supremacist anti-Black stereotypes. For this reason, these stories of Wells, Willard, and Addams are not only important as history but also as examples of how people today who claim to be allies need to be reflexive and of when they should defer to the lead of those most directly affected by an issue. Our aim here, with respect to Addams and Willard, is to paint a more complex picture of them \u2013 particularly of Addams. We\u2019re all formed by discourses, practices, and moral economies of interlocking oppression. They shape what we can know, believe, and perceive. It\u2019s not that this shaping is out of the realm of our influence or that either woman is innocent. Recognizing these complexities and holding their positive anti-oppressive practice in tension with the clearly racist, classist, and otherwise oppressive things they did is useful in helping us all understand that we\u2019re complicit in oppression even when working against it. Acknowledging this complicity is a crucial part of critical or anti-oppressive practice.144 Early Black social workers were not perfect either. Like everyone else, they were flawed people with imperfect politics who sometimes did oppressive things and often held problematic views about other people. They were part of the project of social work\u2019s new and politically complicated interventions into the social world, and sometimes this project brought an increase in surveillance, assimilation, classism, cisheterosexism, and social control into Black communities. We don\u2019t want to paint a picture of any of these figures as perfect, because we can only follow in the footsteps of the types of people that we know to have existed. As Davis asks of representations of Martin Luther King, Jr: \u201cHow could you possibly measure up to someone like that?\u201d145 She stresses that the Montgomery bus boycott \u2013 widely considered the birth of the civil rights movement \u2013 was started by ordinary people just like any one of us, and she emphasizes how important it is for us to know this in order to open possibilities for considering what role we might play in fundamental social transformation. Maggie L. Walker and the Independent Order of St Luke Maggie L. Walker\u2019s record of significantly intervening into the social world begins with her participation in what is believed to be the first anti-segregation school strike by Black students in the United States in 1883. She went on to become a teacher and part-time worker at an insurance company and later was hired as the secretary for the Independent Order of St Luke in Richmond, Virginia. The order had been founded in 1867 by former slave Mary Prout in Baltimore.146 Lily Hardy Hammond, writing in 1922, describes the Order of St Luke when Walker first came on board as \u201ca little benefit society in Richmond \u2013 one of probably a dozen or two,\u201d which had around 1,000 members. These societies were commonplace in Black communities where \u201csickness [was] a catastrophe such as only the poorest people can fully comprehend.\u201d The society paid its members out of dues if a member became sick or died, \u201cthus saving the family from what is often, among the very poor, a crushing burden of debt.\u201d147 At a time when nation-states were just beginning to offer workers\u2019 compensation themselves, local collective organizations, included this one started by Prout, acted as a social safety net. Working class people, including Black people and recent immigrants, would cumulatively contribute to a fund, and the collective would then support them from that fund if they needed it.148 The gradual development of private disability, workers\u2019 compensation, and life insurance are commonly described as contributing to the development of the modern welfare state and as a key part of social work history.149 Walker worked to expand services; by 1922, there were 100,000 members with the organization across twenty-one states. Walker also started the St Luke\u2019s Herald, which provided community and organizational news, and covered topics that preoccupied social work publications of the day such as \u201chealth, thrift, morals, and education.\u201d150 The Herald also provided detailed accounts of lynchings, segregation, and racism. The order adopted political positions, including supporting universal suffrage and anti-lynching efforts. It led the Richmond streetcar boycott against segregation in 1904.151 The Independent Order of St Luke created a bank in 1903 under Walker\u2019s direction. Walker thus became the first woman president of a bank in the United States. The bank provided financing for Black people to buy homes and go to college, among other things.152 These funds would have been otherwise difficult or impossible for Black people in the South to obtain. The predominantly circulated history of the credit union is that it was spread by Desjardins to the United States in 1908.153 Credit unions began in Germany, and had begun to be established in Qu\u00e9bec by Alphonse Desjardins in 1900 to help low-income people secure credit. Walker\u2019s bank seems to have been aligned with the ethos of early collectivist credit unions. When such work is undertaken by a disadvantaged racialized group to provide services for those who couldn\u2019t otherwise access them due to racial segregation and rampant poverty, it is a significant intervention into the social world, enabling people to better navigate and mitigate capitalism\u2019s violences. In 1909, Walker wrote that she wished to \u201cturn the course of that almighty stream of dollar, and see if we can till our own barren lands, feed our own hungry, and clothe our own naked.\u201d154 Yet, this bank is not considered part of credit union history. Like many other early women social workers of her time, Walker was also involved in club work. She founded a Richmond Council of Colored Women, which did community service and fundraising.155 When given the opportunity, Walker and other community members fundraised to establish a home for young women, with help from a white philanthropist. According to Walker, \u201cThe white philanthropist \u2026 said that if we colored women would show our interest in social work among our people by raising a thousand dollars for it, he would give us the use of a large house, and if we made good, he would deed it to a board of white and colored women for colored work.\u201d156 In response to this possibility, the community raised the money, and the women established the home. Walker said that white women in Richmond \u201chad done fine community work for white people,\u201d but that, with respect to this project, \u201cthe white women don\u2019t work for us, \u2013 they work with us.\u201d157 Walker worked with whomever was necessary, doing whatever was necessary, to help the Black community of Richmond and, indeed, the whole country. However, if you check the index of any social work text that is not specifically about Black social work, it is almost guaranteed that you won\u2019t find her name there. The Social Work Profession, Social Science, and Education Through the Progressive Era, many professions were not accessible to Black people in Canada and the United States because of the racist, segregationist educational and economic systems. Francille Wilson writes that the only two professions open to Black people were \u201cteaching and preaching,\u201d158 neither of which required a degree at the time. Social work had the potential to be yet another accessible profession for Black people,159 given that it was outside the systems of governing accredited bodies and academic programs (unlike law and medicine, by this time). Decent paid jobs were frequently obtainable for Black social workers in a number of social sectors, although often in segregated agencies or departments.160 The availability of social work jobs may, in part, explain why an increasing number of Black (and white) men entered the profession, which had previously been considered women\u2019s work.161 In fact, differentiating social work from charity often mapped onto differentiating the work that men were doing from that which women had been doing previously.162 An increasing emphasis on the use of social science was present in Black social work at the time. In the late nineteenth century, W.E.B. Du Bois started doing sociological studies of Black communities that served to identify their needs and combat racist notions about them.163 Some social science emphasized the desire to take social work out of the hands of the churches,164 but social science was taken up by social gospellers as well.165 As in white social work, a belief in the importance of systematic and scientific social work was commonly held by Black social workers across the political spectrum during this period.166 Black social workers also developed social work educational programs, with the first undergraduate program beginning in 1911.167 George Haynes, co-founder of the National Urban League (discussed earlier), established the program at Fisk University and advocated that an understanding of Black history was necessary for Black people to conduct effective Black social work.168 Haynes was motivated by the desire to ensure that Black service users were served by Black workers and that Black social workers did not become a professional underclass because they had fewer academic credentials.169 The first social work graduate program at a Black educational institution was established in 1922 at Atlanta\u2019s Morehouse College,170 and several other programs were created around the same time.171 Although social work programs had previously been available in white institutions, they did not teach from a Black perspective or address needs that were considered important in Black communities. Black Social Work in Canada Black social work in Canada has a number of similarities to the US history: churches played a major role in community work, reform efforts, and charity; there was a strong tradition of neighbour-to-neighbour helping and community improvement; and women took on important organizing roles, particularly with respect to schools and anti-slavery organizing.172 However, because Black communities were so much smaller in Canada than in the United States, and because of other factors such as political economy, geography, and climate, there were important differences too. The level of formal organization that occurred in the United States was simply not present in Canadian Black communities during the Progressive Era.173 Nonetheless, Black social work and social workers made important contributions to their communities and to the emerging profession of social work. Canada had a significant Black population for a number of reasons, including its own legacy of slavery, which began in 1628 when the first African slave was brought to what is now called Canada.174 The main sources of Black immigrants to Canada were slaves who accompanied British loyalists during the American Revolution, escaped slaves from Jamaica (known as the Maroons), freemen after the War of 1812, escaped American slaves through the Underground Railroad, and free US Black people trying to avoid American racism.175 Black communities in Canada during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were largely found in Ontario (called Upper Canada, Canada West, and the Province of Canada at various times) and Nova Scotia,176 although there were also notable populations on Vancouver Island177 and in Montr\u00e9al178 and several smaller cities.179 This settlement pattern was largely a product of the proximity of these English-speaking areas to the United States. Some Black settlers also migrated to the western provinces, but the government instituted anti-Black immigration policies before their numbers could rise significantly, as we discuss in chapter 4.180 Many US regions where Black people were legally \u201cfree\u201d had Black Laws or Black Codes, which seriously restricted the freedom and ability of many Black people to settle. This legal framework was yet another reason some Black people immigrated to Canada.181 In 1850, the US government passed the Fugitive Slave Act, allowing for the arrest of any escaped slave anywhere in the United States and requiring that person\u2019s return to their former \u201cowner.\u201d182 In the years following the passage of this act, around 50,000 former slaves* immigrated to Upper Canada.183 (To provide some perspective, the population of Toronto, called York at the time, was only 100,000 in 1841.184) Settlements in Canada A number of settlements were intentionally established as communities for escaped slaves and other Black people seeking a better life outside the pervasive and institutional racism of the United States. While this organizing has not been traditionally depicted as social work, those responsible for these initiatives were clearly engaged in making individuals\u2019 lives better,\n\nChapman, Chris; Withers, A.J.. A Violent History of Benevolence: Interlocking Oppression in the Moral Economies of Social Working (pp. 101-105). University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division. Edi\u00e7\u00e3o do Kindle. strengthening their communities, and undertaking many efforts that would later be called social work when white people did the same things for recent immigrants from Europe. It should be noted, though, that in spite of Canada\u2019s depiction as a refuge for Black people, many were surprised to find extreme racism in Canada as well.185 This hostility, as well as the difficulty of living off the land, meant that most people in the settlements had very difficult lives. A group of Black people who lived in Cincinnati organized to leave the city and travel to Canada in 1829. Cincinnati was a trading hub with the South, and white power brokers ensured that it was inhospitable to Black people.186 The city enforced the state\u2019s Black Laws, requiring, among other things, that new Black residents pay a $500 bond to ensure that they would be of good behaviour.187 In 1829, massive anti-Black race riots took place in Cincinnati. In an attempt to quell the violence and protect their families and property, about 300 Black men agreed to a government plan to voluntarily go to jail.188 This removal of adult men from the community did not quell the white attacks. However, according to Woodson, when the rioting ended, a number of the men who had surrendered themselves \u201cwere discharged on certificates of nativity, others gave bond for their support and good behavior, a few were dismissed as non-residents, a number of them were discharged by a justice of the Court of Common Pleas, and the rest were held indefinitely.\u201d189 Black men who had voluntarily agreed to be incarcerated in the hopes of staving off white violence were forced into forms of bail bonds, driven from the city, or indefinitely imprisoned. Prior to this incident, a group of local organizers had been planning to create a community in Ontario. The organizers likely chose an isolated rural area because they wanted to protect their community from white racism and aspired to achieve economic self-sufficiency.190 The numbers swelled after the riot; somewhere between 460 and 2,000 people fled to Canada. They settled in a community they called Wilberforce, near London, Ontario.191 Over the next decade, a school, stores, and farms were established. Wilberforce is depicted as a failure in the historical literature, but Nikki Taylor notes that the settlement met its original goal of independence.192 One of the reasons it was ultimately unsustainable was that the Canada Land Company, the Crown corporation that sold land to settlers, stopped selling land to Black settlers due to protests from white settlers in the region and the common white supremacist belief that Black people were not reliable enough to uphold their contracts.* In comparison to other settlements, Wilberforce was thus quite short lived. Yet, it provided an escape for many people fleeing racist violence and the Black Codes. Another settlement established near Windsor by the Refugee Home Society was founded in 1851,193 the year after the Fugitive Slave Act was passed and a mass exodus from the United States to Canada began in response. The Refugee Home Society offered a land-granting program with a systematic approach for providing assistance. Fugitive slaves were granted land (twenty-five acres, five acres of which were free). Settlers were then given nine years to pay for the remaining land, and the profits from the venture went into operating a school and continuing the organization\u2019s work, such as buying more land.194 One of the men credited with founding the Refugee Home Society is Henry Bibb. According to Fred Landon, Bibb believed that \u201cthe future of the people of color in Canada depended upon getting them settled on the land and his mind turned to the possibilities of establishing a distinctly Negro colony.\u201d195 For Bibb and the many Black people who lived in, organized, and supported Black colonies, this venture was a liberatory project. For the people who found refuge in Canada, it was also a liberatory project. Yet, while this designation is straightforwardly true, these Black people were also setting up colonies within a white settler colony. Celebrating Bibb in 1920, Landon titled his article \u201cHenry Bibb, a Colonizer.\u201d Bibb saw his chance for freedom for himself and his community as an active part of the colonial process. What was justice for his community helped sustain an injustice for another. Noticing how this one intensely oppressed group was complicit in the oppression of Indigenous people is, by no means, an attempt to undermine the horrors of slavery, including kidnapping, rape, enslavement, torture, and murder. Escaped slaves and other Black people were not wrong to flee to Canada. It was necessary for self-preservation, born of a context in which Black people had mostly come to the Americas through the brutality of the transatlantic slave trade. Bibb\u2019s colonizing can therefore be clearly distinguished from Europeans\u2019 choice to become part of the colonial project. However, it complicates things that former slaves adopted the role of settler. As Sunera Thobani describes, the colonial context of Canada (and the United States) results in any settlement and citizenship being complicit in the continued dispossession of Indigenous peoples\u2019 lands and sovereignty.196 Importantly, she notes this complicity alongside a careful study of the racism experienced by racialized immigrants in Canada, and she suggests that unless fundamental change is made at the level of what the nation is and its relationship to Indigenous communities and nations, the colonial complicity of all settlers remains an unresolvable dilemma. Mahmood says that agency lies not only in resisting social norms but also in how one inhabits norms. Whether in relation to Black women following the mores of separate spheres or escaped slaves taking up the work of colonization, clearly only so many options were available to long-denigrated peoples to enable them to survive and perform respectability. They may have reinforced oppressive mores and underlying moral economies of human value by doing what they did, but perhaps this contradiction might serve to invite us to reflect upon how each of us today uniquely inhabits oppressive mores, outside the simple framings of resistance versus complicity.197 Like many others, Bibb escaped slavery by becoming a colonizer. To complicate matters even further, the \u201cowner\u201d from whom he escaped was Indigenous.* Bibb wrote of his former slave master: \u201cHe was the most reasonable, and humane slaveholder that I have ever belonged to.\u201d He wrote that he would rather be owned by an Indigenous person than a white person.198 Yet, he was nevertheless this other man\u2019s legal property. Encouraging slave ownership was a US government tactic of assimilating Indigenous people in the South;199 it was a way Indigenous people were encouraged to inhabit \u201ccivilized\u201d mores. Certainly, some Indigenous people having owned slaves does nothing to cancel out or trump colonial injustices. Furthermore, Indigenous nations\u2019 responses to Black slavery were as diverse as the nations themselves. The Cherokee nation is said to have engaged in the most extensive Black slave ownership of all Indigenous groups: by the 1860s, the 17,000 members of the Cherokee nation owned 4,000 Black slaves.\u2020 The Seminole and Tuscarora nations, in contrast, provided safe haven for escaped slaves, resulting in many mixed relationships.200 Indigenous people had also been forced into slavery by Europeans and white settlers, starting with Columbus in 1492.201 Alan Gallay estimates that the British were involved in the slave trade of 30,000 to 50,000 Indigenous people in the United States by 1715.202 The practice of enslaving Indigenous people, however, was largely abandoned in the United States by 1720, in part because of militant resistance on the part of Indigenous nations.203 In telling Bibb\u2019s story, we hope to invite consideration of just how complex these histories are, rather than point fingers here or there. Bibb was a fugitive slave who, like so many slaves, was the son of a slave mother and a white father,204 and was likely conceived through the rape of his mother. He had been owned by a First Nations man on colonized land. Bibb escaped when his Indigenous master died, and went on to become a colonizer, purchasing land from the same British Crown that had stolen the land from Indigenous peoples across what\u2019s now called Canada and the United States. He did so to provide safe haven for other escaped slaves. Bibb was a social worker who contributed to founding an organization that helped his community secure basic freedom, education, and security. Bibb\u2019s story illustrates the intensity with which histories of slavery, colonialism, patriarchy, and social work interlock. When this social worker intervened in one political problem that was most pressing for him, he couldn\u2019t help but actively participate in another. Perhaps, in limitless variations, this complexity is the history of social work. Anti-Slavery Societies and Black Immigrant Assistance The earliest Black social work focused largely on assisting people who escaped slavery and fled to Canada, often with no money, no food, and no spare clothing. Rather than imagining this work to be exceptionally \u201cparticular\u201d to Black communities and therefore irrelevant to the subsequent development of social work more generally, we should look on it as work that helped to meet the needs of a group of people who were struggling as a result of unjust social conditions (as can be said of many social workings today and in the past). There was no state assistance for fugitive slaves (with the exception of Black people who emigrated after the War of 1812 and had assisted the British forces, who were given land).205 In response to this socially constituted need, a massive voluntary effort was undertaken to assist escaped slaves, which involved Black and white people collaborating in anti-slavery and liberation societies.206 These groups helped people find jobs, provided food and other resources, and more generally did the work that would later be called social work when undertaken in an organized way within poor white migrant communities. They also crossed national boundaries, just as later professional social work would do;207 for example, the American Anti-Slavery Society sent agents across the border to Canada to assist escaped slaves.208 These organizations fostered an ethos of mutual aid. Many of the people providing and organizing support were escaped slaves who had established themselves in Canada.209 Organizations like the Fugitives\u2019 Home and the Windsor Anti-Slavery Society were founded and run by fugitive slaves determined to assist other fugitives.210 Several were run by Black women, including the Ladies Freedman\u2019s Aid Society, the Ladies Colored Fugitive Association, and the Toronto Ladies\u2019 Association for the Relief of Destitute Colored Fugitives.211 Sharing the sensibility of what would soon be called social work, these organizations often believed that indiscriminate relief was bad and that aid should be restricted and controlled. For instance, the 1853 report of the Canada Anti-Slavery Society says: \u201cAll that able-bodied men and women require is a fair chance, friendly advice, and a little encouragement, perhaps a little assistance at first. Those who are really willing to work can procure employment in a short time after their arrival.\u201d212 While the fugitive relief effort was carried out on a massive scale, individual aid was often restricted, due to prevalent discourses of liberalism, capitalism, and scientific charity. It also bears repeating, yet again, that such relief efforts later run by white people for recent immigrants from Europe is called the origin of social work. Social Services A number of social work and social service projects were organized by members of Black communities in order to assist others in their communities. While some white people were also involved in helping escaped slaves, charitable and social services were segregated in Canada. Edward Lee and Ilyan Ferrer describe \u201csystemic exclusion from white social work institutions\u201d for the Black community.213 They also argue that \u201cthe exclusionary logic of the colour line was reflective of how communities of colour were racially segregated within the Canadian urban geography and provides further explanation as to why they were unable to access the white dominant charity or social settlement movements.\u201d The community building, aid, organizing, and advocacy that Black people did (and continue to do) are very clearly within the realm of what is considered social work, even though it has not been recognized as such in social work history: Elizabeth Jackson Shadd Shreve travelled through Southern Ontario forests to visit sick people and deliver food and clothing to those without;214 and Black people created youth groups, housing cooperatives, and political organizations like the Nova Scotia Association for the Advancement of Coloured People and the National Black Coalition in Nova Scotia.215 Benevolence clubs were also an important site of social service delivery and community building. One of the most prominent was called the True Band Society, which organized to create Black community self-sufficiency.216 The first True Band was founded in Amherstburg, Ontario (near Windsor), in 1854.217 Like the Provincial Union Association founded the same year, it worked to create and support Black community self-sufficiency.218 The True Bands provided resources to poor Black families, provided care for sick people, supported schools, and worked to resolve conflicts among community members.219 By 1856, there were",

Rather than deeply reflecting on her position, this white person in a leadership position, and the organization under her direction, dug in their heels and refused to acknowledge the harm they\u2019d caused. The white people thus claimed their own innocence143 and, worse still, depicted themselves as wronged for having been accused of racism. The implication is that the Black community organizers who challenged the organization\u2019s position were overreacting, too sensitive, and too angry \u2013 all of which reaffirms white supremacist anti-Black stereotypes. For this reason, these stories of Wells, Willard, and Addams are not only important as history but also as examples of how people today who claim to be allies need to be reflexive and of when they should defer to the lead of those most directly affected by an issue. Our aim here, with respect to Addams and Willard, is to paint a more complex picture of them \u2013 particularly of Addams. We\u2019re all formed by discourses, practices, and moral economies of interlocking oppression. They shape what we can know, believe, and perceive. It\u2019s not that this shaping is out of the realm of our influence or that either woman is innocent. Recognizing these complexities and holding their positive anti-oppressive practice in tension with the clearly racist, classist, and otherwise oppressive things they did is useful in helping us all understand that we\u2019re complicit in oppression even when working against it. Acknowledging this complicity is a crucial part of critical or anti-oppressive practice.144 Early Black social workers were not perfect either. Like everyone else, they were flawed people with imperfect politics who sometimes did oppressive things and often held problematic views about other people. They were part of the project of social work\u2019s new and politically complicated interventions into the social world, and sometimes this project brought an increase in surveillance, assimilation, classism, cisheterosexism, and social control into Black communities. We don\u2019t want to paint a picture of any of these figures as perfect, because we can only follow in the footsteps of the types of people that we know to have existed. As Davis asks of representations of Martin Luther King, Jr: \u201cHow could you possibly measure up to someone like that?\u201d145 She stresses that the Montgomery bus boycott \u2013 widely considered the birth of the civil rights movement \u2013 was started by ordinary people just like any one of us, and she emphasizes how important it is for us to know this in order to open possibilities for considering what role we might play in fundamental social transformation. Maggie L. Walker and the Independent Order of St Luke Maggie L. Walker\u2019s record of significantly intervening into the social world begins with her participation in what is believed to be the first anti-segregation school strike by Black students in the United States in 1883. She went on to become a teacher and part-time worker at an insurance company and later was hired as the secretary for the Independent Order of St Luke in Richmond, Virginia. The order had been founded in 1867 by former slave Mary Prout in Baltimore.146 Lily Hardy Hammond, writing in 1922, describes the Order of St Luke when Walker first came on board as \u201ca little benefit society in Richmond \u2013 one of probably a dozen or two,\u201d which had around 1,000 members. These societies were commonplace in Black communities where \u201csickness [was] a catastrophe such as only the poorest people can fully comprehend.\u201d The society paid its members out of dues if a member became sick or died, \u201cthus saving the family from what is often, among the very poor, a crushing burden of debt.\u201d147 At a time when nation-states were just beginning to offer workers\u2019 compensation themselves, local collective organizations, included this one started by Prout, acted as a social safety net. Working class people, including Black people and recent immigrants, would cumulatively contribute to a fund, and the collective would then support them from that fund if they needed it.148 The gradual development of private disability, workers\u2019 compensation, and life insurance are commonly described as contributing to the development of the modern welfare state and as a key part of social work history.149 Walker worked to expand services; by 1922, there were 100,000 members with the organization across twenty-one states. Walker also started the St Luke\u2019s Herald, which provided community and organizational news, and covered topics that preoccupied social work publications of the day such as \u201chealth, thrift, morals, and education.\u201d150 The Herald also provided detailed accounts of lynchings, segregation, and racism. The order adopted political positions, including supporting universal suffrage and anti-lynching efforts. It led the Richmond streetcar boycott against segregation in 1904.151 The Independent Order of St Luke created a bank in 1903 under Walker\u2019s direction. Walker thus became the first woman president of a bank in the United States. The bank provided financing for Black people to buy homes and go to college, among other things.152 These funds would have been otherwise difficult or impossible for Black people in the South to obtain. The predominantly circulated history of the credit union is that it was spread by Desjardins to the United States in 1908.153 Credit unions began in Germany, and had begun to be established in Qu\u00e9bec by Alphonse Desjardins in 1900 to help low-income people secure credit. Walker\u2019s bank seems to have been aligned with the ethos of early collectivist credit unions. When such work is undertaken by a disadvantaged racialized group to provide services for those who couldn\u2019t otherwise access them due to racial segregation and rampant poverty, it is a significant intervention into the social world, enabling people to better navigate and mitigate capitalism\u2019s violences. In 1909, Walker wrote that she wished to \u201cturn the course of that almighty stream of dollar, and see if we can till our own barren lands, feed our own hungry, and clothe our own naked.\u201d154 Yet, this bank is not considered part of credit union history. Like many other early women social workers of her time, Walker was also involved in club work. She founded a Richmond Council of Colored Women, which did community service and fundraising.155 When given the opportunity, Walker and other community members fundraised to establish a home for young women, with help from a white philanthropist. According to Walker, \u201cThe white philanthropist \u2026 said that if we colored women would show our interest in social work among our people by raising a thousand dollars for it, he would give us the use of a large house, and if we made good, he would deed it to a board of white and colored women for colored work.\u201d156 In response to this possibility, the community raised the money, and the women established the home. Walker said that white women in Richmond \u201chad done fine community work for white people,\u201d but that, with respect to this project, \u201cthe white women don\u2019t work for us, \u2013 they work with us.\u201d157 Walker worked with whomever was necessary, doing whatever was necessary, to help the Black community of Richmond and, indeed, the whole country. However, if you check the index of any social work text that is not specifically about Black social work, it is almost guaranteed that you won\u2019t find her name there. The Social Work Profession, Social Science, and Education Through the Progressive Era, many professions were not accessible to Black people in Canada and the United States because of the racist, segregationist educational and economic systems. Francille Wilson writes that the only two professions open to Black people were \u201cteaching and preaching,\u201d158 neither of which required a degree at the time. Social work had the potential to be yet another accessible profession for Black people,159 given that it was outside the systems of governing accredited bodies and academic programs (unlike law and medicine, by this time). Decent paid jobs were frequently obtainable for Black social workers in a number of social sectors, although often in segregated agencies or departments.160 The availability of social work jobs may, in part, explain why an increasing number of Black (and white) men entered the profession, which had previously been considered women\u2019s work.161 In fact, differentiating social work from charity often mapped onto differentiating the work that men were doing from that which women had been doing previously.162 An increasing emphasis on the use of social science was present in Black social work at the time. In the late nineteenth century, W.E.B. Du Bois started doing sociological studies of Black communities that served to identify their needs and combat racist notions about them.163 Some social science emphasized the desire to take social work out of the hands of the churches,164 but social science was taken up by social gospellers as well.165 As in white social work, a belief in the importance of systematic and scientific social work was commonly held by Black social workers across the political spectrum during this period.166 Black social workers also developed social work educational programs, with the first undergraduate program beginning in 1911.167 George Haynes, co-founder of the National Urban League (discussed earlier), established the program at Fisk University and advocated that an understanding of Black history was necessary for Black people to conduct effective Black social work.168 Haynes was motivated by the desire to ensure that Black service users were served by Black workers and that Black social workers did not become a professional underclass because they had fewer academic credentials.169 The first social work graduate program at a Black educational institution was established in 1922 at Atlanta\u2019s Morehouse College,170 and several other programs were created around the same time.171 Although social work programs had previously been available in white institutions, they did not teach from a Black perspective or address needs that were considered important in Black communities. Black Social Work in Canada Black social work in Canada has a number of similarities to the US history: churches played a major role in community work, reform efforts, and charity; there was a strong tradition of neighbour-to-neighbour helping and community improvement; and women took on important organizing roles, particularly with respect to schools and anti-slavery organizing.172 However, because Black communities were so much smaller in Canada than in the United States, and because of other factors such as political economy, geography, and climate, there were important differences too. The level of formal organization that occurred in the United States was simply not present in Canadian Black communities during the Progressive Era.173 Nonetheless, Black social work and social workers made important contributions to their communities and to the emerging profession of social work. Canada had a significant Black population for a number of reasons, including its own legacy of slavery, which began in 1628 when the first African slave was brought to what is now called Canada.174 The main sources of Black immigrants to Canada were slaves who accompanied British loyalists during the American Revolution, escaped slaves from Jamaica (known as the Maroons), freemen after the War of 1812, escaped American slaves through the Underground Railroad, and free US Black people trying to avoid American racism.175 Black communities in Canada during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were largely found in Ontario (called Upper Canada, Canada West, and the Province of Canada at various times) and Nova Scotia,176 although there were also notable populations on Vancouver Island177 and in Montr\u00e9al178 and several smaller cities.179 This settlement pattern was largely a product of the proximity of these English-speaking areas to the United States. Some Black settlers also migrated to the western provinces, but the government instituted anti-Black immigration policies before their numbers could rise significantly, as we discuss in chapter 4.180 Many US regions where Black people were legally \u201cfree\u201d had Black Laws or Black Codes, which seriously restricted the freedom and ability of many Black people to settle. This legal framework was yet another reason some Black people immigrated to Canada.181 In 1850, the US government passed the Fugitive Slave Act, allowing for the arrest of any escaped slave anywhere in the United States and requiring that person\u2019s return to their former \u201cowner.\u201d182 In the years following the passage of this act, around 50,000 former slaves* immigrated to Upper Canada.183 (To provide some perspective, the population of Toronto, called York at the time, was only 100,000 in 1841.184) Settlements in Canada A number of settlements were intentionally established as communities for escaped slaves and other Black people seeking a better life outside the pervasive and institutional racism of the United States. While this organizing has not been traditionally depicted as social work, those responsible for these initiatives were clearly engaged in making individuals\u2019 lives better,\n\nChapman, Chris; Withers, A.J..

Edi\u00e7\u00e3o do Kindle. strengthening their communities, and undertaking many efforts that would later be called social work when white people did the same things for recent immigrants from Europe. It should be noted, though, that in spite of Canada\u2019s depiction as a refuge for Black people, many were surprised to find extreme racism in Canada as well.185 This hostility, as well as the difficulty of living off the land, meant that most people in the settlements had very difficult lives. A group of Black people who lived in Cincinnati organized to leave the city and travel to Canada in 1829. Cincinnati was a trading hub with the South, and white power brokers ensured that it was inhospitable to Black people.186 The city enforced the state\u2019s Black Laws, requiring, among other things, that new Black residents pay a $500 bond to ensure that they would be of good behaviour.187 In 1829, massive anti-Black race riots took place in Cincinnati. In an attempt to quell the violence and protect their families and property, about 300 Black men agreed to a government plan to voluntarily go to jail.188 This removal of adult men from the community did not quell the white attacks. However, according to Woodson, when the rioting ended, a number of the men who had surrendered themselves \u201cwere discharged on certificates of nativity, others gave bond for their support and good behavior, a few were dismissed as non-residents, a number of them were discharged by a justice of the Court of Common Pleas, and the rest were held indefinitely.\u201d189 Black men who had voluntarily agreed to be incarcerated in the hopes of staving off white violence were forced into forms of bail bonds, driven from the city, or indefinitely imprisoned. Prior to this incident, a group of local organizers had been planning to create a community in Ontario. The organizers likely chose an isolated rural area because they wanted to protect their community from white racism and aspired to achieve economic self-sufficiency.190 The numbers swelled after the riot; somewhere between 460 and 2,000 people fled to Canada. They settled in a community they called Wilberforce, near London, Ontario.191 Over the next decade, a school, stores, and farms were established. Wilberforce is depicted as a failure in the historical literature, but Nikki Taylor notes that the settlement met its original goal of independence.192 One of the reasons it was ultimately unsustainable was that the Canada Land Company, the Crown corporation that sold land to settlers, stopped selling land to Black settlers due to protests from white settlers in the region and the common white supremacist belief that Black people were not reliable enough to uphold their contracts.* In comparison to other settlements, Wilberforce was thus quite short lived. Yet, it provided an escape for many people fleeing racist violence and the Black Codes. Another settlement established near Windsor by the Refugee Home Society was founded in 1851,193 the year after the Fugitive Slave Act was passed and a mass exodus from the United States to Canada began in response. The Refugee Home Society offered a land-granting program with a systematic approach for providing assistance. Fugitive slaves were granted land (twenty-five acres, five acres of which were free). Settlers were then given nine years to pay for the remaining land, and the profits from the venture went into operating a school and continuing the organization\u2019s work, such as buying more land.194 One of the men credited with founding the Refugee Home Society is Henry Bibb. According to Fred Landon, Bibb believed that \u201cthe future of the people of color in Canada depended upon getting them settled on the land and his mind turned to the possibilities of establishing a distinctly Negro colony.\u201d195 For Bibb and the many Black people who lived in, organized, and supported Black colonies, this venture was a liberatory project. For the people who found refuge in Canada, it was also a liberatory project. Yet, while this designation is straightforwardly true, these Black people were also setting up colonies within a white settler colony. Celebrating Bibb in 1920, Landon titled his article \u201cHenry Bibb, a Colonizer.\u201d Bibb saw his chance for freedom for himself and his community as an active part of the colonial process. What was justice for his community helped sustain an injustice for another. Noticing how this one intensely oppressed group was complicit in the oppression of Indigenous people is, by no means, an attempt to undermine the horrors of slavery, including kidnapping, rape, enslavement, torture, and murder. Escaped slaves and other Black people were not wrong to flee to Canada. It was necessary for self-preservation, born of a context in which Black people had mostly come to the Americas through the brutality of the transatlantic slave trade. Bibb\u2019s colonizing can therefore be clearly distinguished from Europeans\u2019 choice to become part of the colonial project. However, it complicates things that former slaves adopted the role of settler. As Sunera Thobani describes, the colonial context of Canada (and the United States) results in any settlement and citizenship being complicit in the continued dispossession of Indigenous peoples\u2019 lands and sovereignty.196 Importantly, she notes this complicity alongside a careful study of the racism experienced by racialized immigrants in Canada, and she suggests that unless fundamental change is made at the level of what the nation is and its relationship to Indigenous communities and nations, the colonial complicity of all settlers remains an unresolvable dilemma. Mahmood says that agency lies not only in resisting social norms but also in how one inhabits norms. Whether in relation to Black women following the mores of separate spheres or escaped slaves taking up the work of colonization, clearly only so many options were available to long-denigrated peoples to enable them to survive and perform respectability. They may have reinforced oppressive mores and underlying moral economies of human value by doing what they did, but perhaps this contradiction might serve to invite us to reflect upon how each of us today uniquely inhabits oppressive mores, outside the simple framings of resistance versus complicity.197 Like many others, Bibb escaped slavery by becoming a colonizer. To complicate matters even further, the \u201cowner\u201d from whom he escaped was Indigenous.* Bibb wrote of his former slave master: \u201cHe was the most reasonable, and humane slaveholder that I have ever belonged to.\u201d He wrote that he would rather be owned by an Indigenous person than a white person.198 Yet, he was nevertheless this other man\u2019s legal property. Encouraging slave ownership was a US government tactic of assimilating Indigenous people in the South;199 it was a way Indigenous people were encouraged to inhabit \u201ccivilized\u201d mores. Certainly, some Indigenous people having owned slaves does nothing to cancel out or trump colonial injustices. Furthermore, Indigenous nations\u2019 responses to Black slavery were as diverse as the nations themselves. The Cherokee nation is said to have engaged in the most extensive Black slave ownership of all Indigenous groups: by the 1860s, the 17,000 members of the Cherokee nation owned 4,000 Black slaves.\u2020 The Seminole and Tuscarora nations, in contrast, provided safe haven for escaped slaves, resulting in many mixed relationships.200 Indigenous people had also been forced into slavery by Europeans and white settlers, starting with Columbus in 1492.201 Alan Gallay estimates that the British were involved in the slave trade of 30,000 to 50,000 Indigenous people in the United States by 1715.202 The practice of enslaving Indigenous people, however, was largely abandoned in the United States by 1720, in part because of militant resistance on the part of Indigenous nations.203 In telling Bibb\u2019s story, we hope to invite consideration of just how complex these histories are, rather than point fingers here or there.

Anti-Slavery Societies and Black Immigrant Assistance The earliest Black social work focused largely on assisting people who escaped slavery and fled to Canada, often with no money, no food, and no spare clothing.

They also crossed national boundaries, just as later professional social work would do;207 for example, the American Anti-Slavery Society sent agents across the border to Canada to assist escaped slaves.208 These organizations fostered an ethos of mutual aid. Many of the people providing and organizing support were escaped slaves who had established themselves in Canada.209 Organizations like the Fugitives\u2019 Home and the Windsor Anti-Slavery Society were founded and run by fugitive slaves determined to assist other fugitives.210 Several were run by Black women, including the Ladies Freedman\u2019s Aid Society, the Ladies Colored Fugitive Association, and the Toronto Ladies\u2019 Association for the Relief of Destitute Colored Fugitives.211 Sharing the sensibility of what would soon be called social work, these organizations often believed that indiscriminate relief was bad and that aid should be restricted and controlled.

One of the most prominent was called the True Band Society, which organized to create Black community self-sufficiency.216 The first True Band was founded in Amherstburg, Ontario (near Windsor), in 1854.217 Like the Provincial Union Association founded the same year, it worked to create and support Black community self-sufficiency.218 The True Bands provided resources to poor Black families, provided care for sick people, supported schools, and worked to resolve conflicts among community members.219 By 1856, there were\n\nChapman, Chris; Withers, A.J..

They considered the raising of funds and supplies from white people to be shameful, and they wanted Black communities to be self-sufficient. They also opposed the construction of Black settlements, calling for people to integrate into Canadian society. One of the strongest voices against collecting resources (\u201cbegging,\u201d as they called it) was Mary Ann Shadd Cary, who was active in Black community social services and media.221 Black communities also built formal institutions modelled after those imported from Europe through colonialism.222 For example, Nova Scotian orphanages and children\u2019s homes wouldn\u2019t admit Black children \u2013 resulting in them sometimes being put in asylums or on work farms.223 Therefore, under the leadership of James R. Johnston and the African United Baptists Association, the Nova Scotia Home for Coloured Children (NSHCC) opened in 1921.224 Due to systemic racial segregation in social services,225 this institution was incredibly important to the Black community. Its opening marked the largest gathering of Black people in Nova Scotia since 1783.226 The NSHCC is an example of the social work initiatives that Black communities undertook in Canada. Candice Roker discusses the \u201cpositive survival\u201d resistance to racist exclusion of Black people in Nova Scotia. She argues that the creation of the NSHCC \u201cis one of the most public examples of the African Nova Scotian community taking care of its own.\u201d227 The NSHCC retained its historical name but became racially integrated in the 1970s;228 it continued to operate as an orphanage until the late 1980s.229 Like so many institutions that house vulnerable children, including Indian residential schools and many institutions for disabled children,230 significant abuses took place at the NSHCC. In 1948, a social worker documented concerns about inadequate food for the children living in the NSHCC. Sexual abuse was documented in the 1980s, including the rape of a child, but no charges were ever laid.231 In 2001, a number of former residents of the home filed lawsuits for abuse,232 some of which dates back to as early as the 1940s.233 In 2014, the premier of Nova Scotia apologized for the abuse as part of a settlement with survivors, and a restorative inquiry was announced in 2015.234 Terrible things happened at this institution that should never happen to anyone. It is entirely possible abuse was present there from its early days. Yet, even then, we can hold this injustice in tension with an acknowledgment of the importance of what the Nova Scotian Black community did by building the home. Building a racially segregated institution, which seems to have been characterized by the same abuses of power as were found at other institutional sites, can be conceptualized as yet another instance of navigating the norms that were available at the time. Black Nova Scotians built for their community\u2019s children a resource often considered at that time indispensable for serving children in need. As in so many other institutions, many children were seriously harmed within its walls. There is frequently a tendency to view historical developments as either good or bad, but removing the NSHCC from \u201cgood\u201d anti-racist history and placing it into \u201cbad\u201d institutional history prevents us from struggling to cultivate a complex relationship with this fundamentally interlocking history and its legacies. Black communities navigated available norms, but didn\u2019t adopt all available norms. As a glaring example with tremendous relevance to contemporary social work, we found no historical record of any Black community in the United States or Canada establishing a child protection agency in which people from outside a family or community scrutinized parents and determined whether a child would be allowed to remain with them. In the extensive social welfare systems created by Black folks in Canada and the United States, we found no evidence of a single Black agency that practised involuntary child apprehension. White child protection agencies didn\u2019t normally* serve Black families until the end of legal racial segregation in the mid-twentieth century. Yet, even in cities with significant Black social welfare infrastructures, including women\u2019s clubs, settlement houses, and orphanages, it seems that no Black community practised child apprehension. (If we\u2019re wrong and one or two communities did so, it would have been extremely marginal considering that we\u2019ve encountered no trace of it.) Black and white social workers learned from one another and often worked together, developing similar (usually racially segregated) services, but Black social workers didn\u2019t practice child apprehension. In the only article we found exploring the fact that professional child welfare didn\u2019t operate in US Black communities until after legal racial segregation was abolished,\u2020 Jillian Jimenez writes: \u201cA shadow child welfare system [existed] that performed similar functions to the public child welfare system from which African American children were largely excluded.\u201d235 In apparently every Black community, people were left to do the work of \u201cchild protection\u201d and \u201cchild welfare\u201d using means that had been available to them before anybody had ever become a paid \u201csocial worker.\u201d In a recent interview about having won the Woman of Distinction Award, Black Canadian politician Zanana Akande was asked where her ethic of \u201ccontinuing to push\u201d for justice originated. In her answer, she described the informal \u201csocial workers who weren\u2019t social workers\u201d who collectively raised her when she was growing up in downtown Toronto in the 1940s and \u201950s: \u201cThat [ethic] comes from where I was born and the people around me \u2013 the first social workers who weren\u2019t social workers, because we were all raised collectively by our parents and by anyone else who happened to walk down the street and see us \u2013 that you must speak out, you must take care of each other, and you must push for what you want.\u201d236 In Black communities prior to the end of racial segregation and the introduction of child protective agencies into Black communities, practices, norms, and mores were in place to protect children from violence, respond to tragedies such as parental death, and so on. \u201cChildren routinely lived with grandparents not only in the case of death, but when one or both parents left the local area to look for work \u2026 [and] children with no family would be taken in by unrelated adults in the neighbourhood who did not have children.\u201d237 Resonant practices have existed in all communities at all times, varying significantly from place to place. Jimenez traces these specific Black child welfare practices to West African traditions of extended kinship and communal care for children, as well as to strategies later developed in response to the violences of slavery \u2013 in which Black children and adults were kidnapped, forcibly separated from one another, and held as white people\u2019s property. In the first half of the twentieth century in Black communities in the United States, the principal strategy for protecting children from abuse and neglect was community surveillance: \u201cthe extended family, especially grandmothers \u2026 aunts, great aunts, and older sisters \u2026 provided a concentric circle of approval and disapproval to support or criticize the child rearing practices of a child\u2019s primary caretakers.\u201d238 There were community-sanctioned interventions for when adults harmed children, which were rooted in community-specific hierarchies of moral and political authority. Older women relatives in Black America occupied the role only then being taken over in white America by paid ruling class strangers. One practice is a violent imposition, and the other assumes communities are capable of healing and protecting themselves; both are specific and situated means of social working to keep children safe from abuse and neglect. A very different child protection system would be in place today if families and communities were imagined capable of protecting and caring for their own children, rather than assuming the state and its professionals must do so. As a consequence of racist laws and mores, Black families were fortunate to rarely have their children apprehended by state authorities during the first half of the twentieth century. Instead, they carried on and internally adapted long-standing traditions of child protection and care. The earliest white child protection agencies were born at a time of normalized extreme anti-Black violence. Black childrearing practices at the time therefore explicitly sought to prevent children from exposing themselves to the normative violences of white supremacy;239 we can imagine the devastation that might have resulted had Black families become targeted by white social work. Black families worked to protect Black children from abusive parents and also from white supremacy. Their efforts were central to Black child protection during a time of widespread lynching and other explicit anti-Black violence. Such child protection isn\u2019t normatively validated as \u201csocial work.\u201d Of all the diverse and significant Black interventions into the social world for over a century, from slavery liberation societies through to the civil rights movement of the mid-twentieth century, there seems to have been a consensus that the approach to \u201cchild protection\u201d taken for granted among white ruling classes wasn\u2019t morally or politically acceptable. No matter how one is positioned in relation to these histories, this wholesale rejection is an astounding fact for us all to seriously reflect upon today. Class Stratification and How It Interlocked with Racism and Social Work As with white social workers, Black social workers in the United States and Canada tended to be upper or middle class people assisting poor people. Class divisions among Black people, however, had different effects and significance from those among white people, given that segregation and racism had a levelling effect on Black communities. No matter how much money you had, you often could not live in a ruling class neighbourhood if you were Black, nor was it easy to get a loan, be free from the threat of racist violence, go many places, or do many other things available to white people. Class status did not inoculate against racism. Carlton-LaNey writes, \u201cThere was very little physical, social and economic distance\u201d between those doing early Black social work and others in the communities where they worked. They \u201clived in the same communities and by virtue of race shared many of the same societal problems and issues of concern.\u201d However, those \u201cwho engaged in the emerging social work profession were among the \u2026 educated elite of the African American community.\u201d240 Educated Black women primarily provided social services,241 which could have perpetuated white ruling class social mores. Yet, Carlton-LaNey asserts that \u201clower class women were also active in clubs and formed organizations in an effort to serve themselves and the needy in their communities.\u201d242 She writes that this class diversity among workers, as well as shared experiences of racism, helped these social workers more reflexively consider their own power: even educated Black social workers with \u201cproperty ownership, poise, and eloquence \u2026 [were often] treated like \u2018washerwomen\u2019 [which] \u2026 kept them attuned to the deplorable conditions to which their less-fortunate sisters were subjected.\u201d243 Through to the 1920s, \u201ca white woman in Halifax looking for help with her laundry felt free to stop any African-Nova Scotian woman on the street and request \u2018where she could get a good girl.\u2019\u201d244 White supremacy served to homogenize Blackness so that, in practice, it was the only relevant identifier in many cases, or at least it was the identity category that trumped all others. The assumption that any Black person would know where to get a cleaner in Halifax was based on the pervasive white supremacist association of Black people with domestic service and dirt. This thinking had important social significance and was intimately tied up with interlocking moral economies of human value. At this time, eugenics was often referred to as \u201cmental hygiene,\u201d245 and Ivory Soap boasted about its ability to \u201ccivilize\u201d Indigenous people.246 This period was also the era in which white ruling class women acquired an unprecedented degree of exalted bourgeois subjectivity. Fellows and Razack explain that dirt was important in constituting these select women as separate and distinct from \u2013 and to imagine themselves morally superior to \u2013 \u201cwasherwomen.\u201d247 The renegotiation of white ruling class women\u2019s positioning within largely unchanged moral economies of human value relied on the intensive and ongoing discursive denigration of others. Remaining racially devalued even with upward class mobility, Black social workers\u2019 experiences of continued discrimination, alongside the relative class diversity among Black service providers, seems to have mitigated the classism normally inherent to social work. Most Black women welfare reformers, according to Gordon, \u201cwere usually newly middle-class, perhaps a generation away from slavery and without much cushion against economic misfortune.\u201d248 These women were living a very different experience of being middle class than that of their white contemporaries.",

It should be noted, though, that in spite of Canada\u2019s depiction as a refuge for Black people, many were surprised to find extreme racism in Canada as well.185 This hostility, as well as the difficulty of living off the land, meant that most people in the settlements had very difficult lives. A group of Black people who lived in Cincinnati organized to leave the city and travel to Canada in 1829. Cincinnati was a trading hub with the South, and white power brokers ensured that it was inhospitable to Black people.186 The city enforced the state\u2019s Black Laws, requiring, among other things, that new Black residents pay a $500 bond to ensure that they would be of good behaviour.187 In 1829, massive anti-Black race riots took place in Cincinnati. In an attempt to quell the violence and protect their families and property, about 300 Black men agreed to a government plan to voluntarily go to jail.188 This removal of adult men from the community did not quell the white attacks. However, according to Woodson, when the rioting ended, a number of the men who had surrendered themselves \u201cwere discharged on certificates of nativity, others gave bond for their support and good behavior, a few were dismissed as non-residents, a number of them were discharged by a justice of the Court of Common Pleas, and the rest were held indefinitely.\u201d189 Black men who had voluntarily agreed to be incarcerated in the hopes of staving off white violence were forced into forms of bail bonds, driven from the city, or indefinitely imprisoned. Prior to this incident, a group of local organizers had been planning to create a community in Ontario. The organizers likely chose an isolated rural area because they wanted to protect their community from white racism and aspired to achieve economic self-sufficiency.190 The numbers swelled after the riot; somewhere between 460 and 2,000 people fled to Canada. They settled in a community they called Wilberforce, near London, Ontario.191 Over the next decade, a school, stores, and farms were established. Wilberforce is depicted as a failure in the historical literature, but Nikki Taylor notes that the settlement met its original goal of independence.192 One of the reasons it was ultimately unsustainable was that the Canada Land Company, the Crown corporation that sold land to settlers, stopped selling land to Black settlers due to protests from white settlers in the region and the common white supremacist belief that Black people were not reliable enough to uphold their contracts.* In comparison to other settlements, Wilberforce was thus quite short lived. Yet, it provided an escape for many people fleeing racist violence and the Black Codes. Another settlement established near Windsor by the Refugee Home Society was founded in 1851,193 the year after the Fugitive Slave Act was passed and a mass exodus from the United States to Canada began in response. The Refugee Home Society offered a land-granting program with a systematic approach for providing assistance. Fugitive slaves were granted land (twenty-five acres, five acres of which were free). Settlers were then given nine years to pay for the remaining land, and the profits from the venture went into operating a school and continuing the organization\u2019s work, such as buying more land.194 One of the men credited with founding the Refugee Home Society is Henry Bibb. According to Fred Landon, Bibb believed that \u201cthe future of the people of color in Canada depended upon getting them settled on the land and his mind turned to the possibilities of establishing a distinctly Negro colony.\u201d195 For Bibb and the many Black people who lived in, organized, and supported Black colonies, this venture was a liberatory project. For the people who found refuge in Canada, it was also a liberatory project. Yet, while this designation is straightforwardly true, these Black people were also setting up colonies within a white settler colony. Celebrating Bibb in 1920, Landon titled his article \u201cHenry Bibb, a Colonizer.\u201d Bibb saw his chance for freedom for himself and his community as an active part of the colonial process. What was justice for his community helped sustain an injustice for another. Noticing how this one intensely oppressed group was complicit in the oppression of Indigenous people is, by no means, an attempt to undermine the horrors of slavery, including kidnapping, rape, enslavement, torture, and murder. Escaped slaves and other Black people were not wrong to flee to Canada. It was necessary for self-preservation, born of a context in which Black people had mostly come to the Americas through the brutality of the transatlantic slave trade. Bibb\u2019s colonizing can therefore be clearly distinguished from Europeans\u2019 choice to become part of the colonial project. However, it complicates things that former slaves adopted the role of settler. As Sunera Thobani describes, the colonial context of Canada (and the United States) results in any settlement and citizenship being complicit in the continued dispossession of Indigenous peoples\u2019 lands and sovereignty.196 Importantly, she notes this complicity alongside a careful study of the racism experienced by racialized immigrants in Canada, and she suggests that unless fundamental change is made at the level of what the nation is and its relationship to Indigenous communities and nations, the colonial complicity of all settlers remains an unresolvable dilemma. Mahmood says that agency lies not only in resisting social norms but also in how one inhabits norms. Whether in relation to Black women following the mores of separate spheres or escaped slaves taking up the work of colonization, clearly only so many options were available to long-denigrated peoples to enable them to survive and perform respectability. They may have reinforced oppressive mores and underlying moral economies of human value by doing what they did, but perhaps this contradiction might serve to invite us to reflect upon how each of us today uniquely inhabits oppressive mores, outside the simple framings of resistance versus complicity.197 Like many others, Bibb escaped slavery by becoming a colonizer. To complicate matters even further, the \u201cowner\u201d from whom he escaped was Indigenous.* Bibb wrote of his former slave master: \u201cHe was the most reasonable, and humane slaveholder that I have ever belonged to.\u201d He wrote that he would rather be owned by an Indigenous person than a white person.198 Yet, he was nevertheless this other man\u2019s legal property. Encouraging slave ownership was a US government tactic of assimilating Indigenous people in the South;199 it was a way Indigenous people were encouraged to inhabit \u201ccivilized\u201d mores. Certainly, some Indigenous people having owned slaves does nothing to cancel out or trump colonial injustices. Furthermore, Indigenous nations\u2019 responses to Black slavery were as diverse as the nations themselves. The Cherokee nation is said to have engaged in the most extensive Black slave ownership of all Indigenous groups: by the 1860s, the 17,000 members of the Cherokee nation owned 4,000 Black slaves.\u2020 The Seminole and Tuscarora nations, in contrast, provided safe haven for escaped slaves, resulting in many mixed relationships.200 Indigenous people had also been forced into slavery by Europeans and white settlers, starting with Columbus in 1492.201 Alan Gallay estimates that the British were involved in the slave trade of 30,000 to 50,000 Indigenous people in the United States by 1715.202 The practice of enslaving Indigenous people, however, was largely abandoned in the United States by 1720, in part because of militant resistance on the part of Indigenous nations.203 In telling Bibb\u2019s story, we hope to invite consideration of just how complex these histories are, rather than point fingers here or there. Bibb was a fugitive slave who, like so many slaves, was the son of a slave mother and a white father,204 and was likely conceived through the rape of his mother. He had been owned by a First Nations man on colonized land. Bibb escaped when his Indigenous master died, and went on to become a colonizer, purchasing land from the same British Crown that had stolen the land from Indigenous peoples across what\u2019s now called Canada and the United States. He did so to provide safe haven for other escaped slaves. Bibb was a social worker who contributed to founding an organization that helped his community secure basic freedom, education, and security. Bibb\u2019s story illustrates the intensity with which histories of slavery, colonialism, patriarchy, and social work interlock. When this social worker intervened in one political problem that was most pressing for him, he couldn\u2019t help but actively participate in another. Perhaps, in limitless variations, this complexity is the history of social work. Anti-Slavery Societies and Black Immigrant Assistance The earliest Black social work focused largely on assisting people who escaped slavery and fled to Canada, often with no money, no food, and no spare clothing. Rather than imagining this work to be exceptionally \u201cparticular\u201d to Black communities and therefore irrelevant to the subsequent development of social work more generally, we should look on it as work that helped to meet the needs of a group of people who were struggling as a result of unjust social conditions (as can be said of many social workings today and in the past). There was no state assistance for fugitive slaves (with the exception of Black people who emigrated after the War of 1812 and had assisted the British forces, who were given land).205 In response to this socially constituted need, a massive voluntary effort was undertaken to assist escaped slaves, which involved Black and white people collaborating in anti-slavery and liberation societies.206 These groups helped people find jobs, provided food and other resources, and more generally did the work that would later be called social work when undertaken in an organized way within poor white migrant communities. They also crossed national boundaries, just as later professional social work would do;207 for example, the American Anti-Slavery Society sent agents across the border to Canada to assist escaped slaves.208 These organizations fostered an ethos of mutual aid. Many of the people providing and organizing support were escaped slaves who had established themselves in Canada.209 Organizations like the Fugitives\u2019 Home and the Windsor Anti-Slavery Society were founded and run by fugitive slaves determined to assist other fugitives.210 Several were run by Black women, including the Ladies Freedman\u2019s Aid Society, the Ladies Colored Fugitive Association, and the Toronto Ladies\u2019 Association for the Relief of Destitute Colored Fugitives.211 Sharing the sensibility of what would soon be called social work, these organizations often believed that indiscriminate relief was bad and that aid should be restricted and controlled. For instance, the 1853 report of the Canada Anti-Slavery Society says: \u201cAll that able-bodied men and women require is a fair chance, friendly advice, and a little encouragement, perhaps a little assistance at first. Those who are really willing to work can procure employment in a short time after their arrival.\u201d212 While the fugitive relief effort was carried out on a massive scale, individual aid was often restricted, due to prevalent discourses of liberalism, capitalism, and scientific charity. It also bears repeating, yet again, that such relief efforts later run by white people for recent immigrants from Europe is called the origin of social work. Social Services A number of social work and social service projects were organized by members of Black communities in order to assist others in their communities. While some white people were also involved in helping escaped slaves, charitable and social services were segregated in Canada. Edward Lee and Ilyan Ferrer describe \u201csystemic exclusion from white social work institutions\u201d for the Black community.213 They also argue that \u201cthe exclusionary logic of the colour line was reflective of how communities of colour were racially segregated within the Canadian urban geography and provides further explanation as to why they were unable to access the white dominant charity or social settlement movements.\u201d The community building, aid, organizing, and advocacy that Black people did (and continue to do) are very clearly within the realm of what is considered social work, even though it has not been recognized as such in social work history: Elizabeth Jackson Shadd Shreve travelled through Southern Ontario forests to visit sick people and deliver food and clothing to those without;214 and Black people created youth groups, housing cooperatives, and political organizations like the Nova Scotia Association for the Advancement of Coloured People and the National Black Coalition in Nova Scotia.215 Benevolence clubs were also an important site of social service delivery and community building. One of the most prominent was called the True Band Society, which organized to create Black community self-sufficiency.216 The first True Band was founded in Amherstburg, Ontario (near Windsor), in 1854.217 Like the Provincial Union Association founded the same year, it worked to create and support Black community self-sufficiency.218 The True Bands provided resources to poor Black families, provided care for sick people, supported schools, and worked to resolve conflicts among community members.219 By 1856, there were\n\nChapman, Chris; Withers, A.J..

They considered the raising of funds and supplies from white people to be shameful, and they wanted Black communities to be self-sufficient.

In her answer, she described the informal \u201csocial workers who weren\u2019t social workers\u201d who collectively raised her when she was growing up in downtown Toronto in the 1940s and \u201950s: \u201cThat [ethic] comes from where I was born and the people around me \u2013 the first social workers who weren\u2019t social workers, because we were all raised collectively by our parents and by anyone else who happened to walk down the street and see us \u2013 that you must speak out, you must take care of each other, and you must push for what you want.\u201d236 In Black communities prior to the end of racial segregation and the introduction of child protective agencies into Black communities, practices, norms, and mores were in place to protect children from violence, respond to tragedies such as parental death, and so on. \u201cChildren routinely lived with grandparents not only in the case of death, but when one or both parents left the local area to look for work \u2026 [and] children with no family would be taken in by unrelated adults in the neighbourhood who did not have children.\u201d237 Resonant practices have existed in all communities at all times, varying significantly from place to place. Jimenez traces these specific Black child welfare practices to West African traditions of extended kinship and communal care for children, as well as to strategies later developed in response to the violences of slavery \u2013 in which Black children and adults were kidnapped, forcibly separated from one another, and held as white people\u2019s property. In the first half of the twentieth century in Black communities in the United States, the principal strategy for protecting children from abuse and neglect was community surveillance: \u201cthe extended family, especially grandmothers \u2026 aunts, great aunts, and older sisters \u2026 provided a concentric circle of approval and disapproval to support or criticize the child rearing practices of a child\u2019s primary caretakers.\u201d238 There were community-sanctioned interventions for when adults harmed children, which were rooted in community-specific hierarchies of moral and political authority. Older women relatives in Black America occupied the role only then being taken over in white America by paid ruling class strangers. One practice is a violent imposition, and the other assumes communities are capable of healing and protecting themselves; both are specific and situated means of social working to keep children safe from abuse and neglect. A very different child protection system would be in place today if families and communities were imagined capable of protecting and caring for their own children, rather than assuming the state and its professionals must do so. As a consequence of racist laws and mores, Black families were fortunate to rarely have their children apprehended by state authorities during the first half of the twentieth century. Instead, they carried on and internally adapted long-standing traditions of child protection and care. The earliest white child protection agencies were born at a time of normalized extreme anti-Black violence. Black childrearing practices at the time therefore explicitly sought to prevent children from exposing themselves to the normative violences of white supremacy;239 we can imagine the devastation that might have resulted had Black families become targeted by white social work. Black families worked to protect Black children from abusive parents and also from white supremacy. Their efforts were central to Black child protection during a time of widespread lynching and other explicit anti-Black violence. Such child protection isn\u2019t normatively validated as \u201csocial work.\u201d Of all the diverse and significant Black interventions into the social world for over a century, from slavery liberation societies through to the civil rights movement of the mid-twentieth century, there seems to have been a consensus that the approach to \u201cchild protection\u201d taken for granted among white ruling classes wasn\u2019t morally or politically acceptable. No matter how one is positioned in relation to these histories, this wholesale rejection is an astounding fact for us all to seriously reflect upon today. Class Stratification and How It Interlocked with Racism and Social Work As with white social workers, Black social workers in the United States and Canada tended to be upper or middle class people assisting poor people. Class divisions among Black people, however, had different effects and significance from those among white people, given that segregation and racism had a levelling effect on Black communities. No matter how much money you had, you often could not live in a ruling class neighbourhood if you were Black, nor was it easy to get a loan, be free from the threat of racist violence, go many places, or do many other things available to white people. Class status did not inoculate against racism. Carlton-LaNey writes, \u201cThere was very little physical, social and economic distance\u201d between those doing early Black social work and others in the communities where they worked. They \u201clived in the same communities and by virtue of race shared many of the same societal problems and issues of concern.\u201d However, those \u201cwho engaged in the emerging social work profession were among the \u2026 educated elite of the African American community.\u201d240 Educated Black women primarily provided social services,241 which could have perpetuated white ruling class social mores. Yet, Carlton-LaNey asserts that \u201clower class women were also active in clubs and formed organizations in an effort to serve themselves and the needy in their communities.\u201d242 She writes that this class diversity among workers, as well as shared experiences of racism, helped these social workers more reflexively consider their own power: even educated Black social workers with \u201cproperty ownership, poise, and eloquence \u2026 [were often] treated like \u2018washerwomen\u2019 [which] \u2026 kept them attuned to the deplorable conditions to which their less-fortunate sisters were subjected.\u201d243 Through to the 1920s, \u201ca white woman in Halifax looking for help with her laundry felt free to stop any African-Nova Scotian woman on the street and request \u2018where she could get a good girl.\u2019\u201d244 White supremacy served to homogenize Blackness so that, in practice, it was the only relevant identifier in many cases, or at least it was the identity category that trumped all others. The assumption that any Black person would know where to get a cleaner in Halifax was based on the pervasive white supremacist association of Black people with domestic service and dirt. This thinking had important social significance and was intimately tied up with interlocking moral economies of human value. At this time, eugenics was often referred to as \u201cmental hygiene,\u201d245 and Ivory Soap boasted about its ability to \u201ccivilize\u201d Indigenous people.246 This period was also the era in which white ruling class women acquired an unprecedented degree of exalted bourgeois subjectivity. Fellows and Razack explain that dirt was important in constituting these select women as separate and distinct from \u2013 and to imagine themselves morally superior to \u2013 \u201cwasherwomen.\u201d247 The renegotiation of white ruling class women\u2019s positioning within largely unchanged moral economies of human value relied on the intensive and ongoing discursive denigration of others. Remaining racially devalued even with upward class mobility, Black social workers\u2019 experiences of continued discrimination, alongside the relative class diversity among Black service providers, seems to have mitigated the classism normally inherent to social work. Most Black women welfare reformers, according to Gordon, \u201cwere usually newly middle-class, perhaps a generation away from slavery and without much cushion against economic misfortune.\u201d248 These women were living a very different experience of being middle class than that of their white contemporaries.\n\nChapman, Chris; Withers, A.J..

However, other scholars cite historical evidence of overt and insidious classism among Black social workers too. Many of the class biases that existed in the work of friendly visitors and other white charity work were also present among Black social work organizations. For example, urban Northern social workers who provided social services to migrants from the South often looked down upon the people they were trying to help. Martin and Martin say that Black social workers, like other urban Northern Americans, perceived the migrants as \u201cuncouth, unkempt, boisterous, and ignorant.\u201d253 Northern urban social workers, Black and white, therefore engaged in what Sheila Weiss calls an \u201ceffort of the middle class to mold the behavior of the migrants in its own image [which] was clearly a one-way process. There was never any hint that the black bourgeoisie had anything to learn from its newly arrived neighbors.\u201d254 Like many other well-meaning people working to affect social change, then and now, early Black social workers often seem to have believed they knew what was best for the people they worked with. But their ideas were often informed by classist moral economies. This classed outlook was evident, for example, when Black professor R.L. Smith of Oakwood, Texas, began community organizing to make his community more aesthetically pleasing in 1889.255 As a ruling class man, he understood the physical appearance of the village to be its most pressing need. It was only after a year, when only minor issues had been resolved and people didn\u2019t follow through on more major and expensive undertakings, that he began to wonder why the response had been so lukewarm. He realized it was because the people he was working with were poor. He concluded that \u201cwhat the Negro farmers of Texas and of the South really needed was not, at this stage, a Village Improvement Society.\u201d256 If Smith had facilitated a conversation about what the community needed and how it should go about achieving those needs at the initial meeting a year earlier, their efforts may have been much more productive. Having largely done nothing for the first year, Smith now set out to reduce poverty, alongside his own aim of getting people to improve their homes and yards. He helped organize a cooperative in which farmers in the area pooled their resources, enabling two important changes: buying in bulk (obtaining discounts for volume purchases) and avoiding the use of credit, which could mean substantial savings in interest payments. After the organization had been somewhat successful in helping farmers gain financial security, an organization called the Negro Cooperative Society was founded. Smith was a supporter of the Booker T. Washington \u2013 or liberal, rather than radical \u2013 school of Black activism, and he tied the ranks in the organization to how much people had saved. Only once someone achieved the twelfth degree, and was thus named \u201cGrand Patriarch,\u201d did they gain a vote at conference.257 The richest members of the cooperative society were granted exclusive voting rights, enabling them to direct the society regardless of support from its majority. Class hierarchy and bias drove this organizational design in a clear illustration of the material effects of moral economy: those already regarded superior tend to accumulate further moral (and thus political) capital. It\u2019s assumed that those who have saved the most money are most deserving and will know best. From there, a structure is built that allows those with the most political and moral capital to gain even more institutional political power \u2013 even in this \u201ccooperative.\u201d Indeed, a large cross-section of Black social workers supported Booker T. Washington\u2019s principles, which \u201cmeasure success by the ownership of land, homes, businesses, union membership, and bank accounts.\u201d258 The class status of most Black social workers, like most social workers in general, informed their values and understandings of the world. According to Peebles-Wilkins and Francis, \u201cThese women\u2019s ideals were [ruling class] American ideals.\u201d259 They accepted the dominant views of society, working to reform some systems of oppression while leaving others intact \u2013 especially capitalism. Peebles-Wilkins and Francis suggest that Black upwardly mobile social workers, such as Mary Church Terrell, \u201cespoused fundamental, traditional American values about family, the work ethic, social obligations, democracy, and freedom that she transmitted cross-culturally.\u201d They write: \u201cThe goals of black women activists focused on uplift and contained the overtones of social Darwinism,\u201d which was the assumed social good of unimpeded competition within existing social and political structures.260 Many Black social workers, like white ones, upheld capitalism, which, after all, was the economic system permitting their upward mobility. They worked towards cumulative individual racial uplift within the parameters of existing economic and moral systems, rather than working to overhaul the system for the benefit of those suffering the most from it. Many social workers, informed by liberal individualism and prevalent moral economies of race and class differentiation, directed their change efforts at individuals rather than the social structures that caused such differentiation. Cornelius Bynum reports that \u201cAfrican American elites largely accommodated white racist assumptions about black inferiority.\u201d261 Martin and Martin suggest that established residents of the urban North \u201cfeared that the newcomers would reinforce stereotypes of black people and stir up antiblack sentiments that would have dire consequences for all black people.\u201d262 While social workers worked to \u201chelp\u201d poor people, they also often worked to normalize and assimilate members of the Black community so that \u2013 like white ruling class women \u2013 they too might gain what Fellows and Razack call a toehold on respectability.263 When social workers did explicitly set out to address systemic issues, they became burnt out, claim Martin and Martin. As a result, in the end, \u201cthey focused their attention on trying to change the character of the victims of the dominant system, helping them to cope better with their oppression.\u201d264 Social work interventions were frequently about normalizing poor Black people and getting them to conform to middle class behaviours, aesthetics, and values.265 This form of social work involved many of the same interventions that the friendly visitors stressed: cleanliness, good housekeeping, temperance, thrift, and so on. The 1921 report of Cincinnati\u2019s Negro Civic Welfare Committee of the Council of Social Agencies demonstrates that the committee was incredibly condescending and paternalistic towards working class people and enacted capitalist indoctrination. The committee operated a workplace friendly visiting program involving over 800 Black women. \u201cShe goes and gives friendly advice on punctuality, regularity, efficiency, thrift, and tries to develop in them the proper attitude toward their work.\u201d266 This committee may well have advocated for workers, and the citation above may have been written to attract donations. Yet, the report depicts this social work organization as working to improve people\u2019s lives by helping them transform into more productive capitalist subjects, something that did nothing to improve the institutionalized social, economic, political, and moral barriers they experienced. We\u2019re not saying that any of the work of early Black social workers shouldn\u2019t have been done. Rather, we can all uniquely interrogate the complexities of the past in order to better understand and interrupt patterns we may continue to replicate, uniquely positioned as each one of us is within these legacies. As bell hooks says, \u201cInterlocking systems [of oppression] indict us all in some way.\u201d267 Early Women Social Workers and Gender Roles Working to ameliorate some of the harshness caused by capitalism while upholding the system itself is similar to how many early women social workers \u2013 Black and white \u2013 approached gender. Separate spheres discourse was incredibly oppressive for women. Yet, its specific contours and divisions also created possibilities for women to take up leadership roles in what came to be called social work. Women encroached into public spaces by intervening into others\u2019 private spheres. As is true of all communities, Black women responded to gendered expectations in diverse ways. Mary Church Terrell, the honorary lifetime president of the National Association of Colored Women (NACW), largely supported separate spheres.268 However, Maggie Walker was adamantly and publicly opposed to separate spheres. Writing in 1912, she argued: \u201cThere is neither justice or good common sense in the demand that every woman should confine her activities to the domestic duties of home . . . As ability, adaptability decide these things for men, so let them decide for woman.\u201d269 Walker, the first woman bank president in the United States, supported equal rights for women, which included for her the abolition of the mores of gendered separate spheres. Furthermore, regardless of their own navigation of separate spheres, many early Black social workers advocated for suffrage and gender equality,* including Mary Ann Shadd Cary,270 Mary Church Terrell, Ida B. Wells-Barnett,271 and Maggie Walker.272 Women exposed themselves to the risks of men\u2019s patriarchal moralizing when they became active in the public sphere. For example, Henry Bibb said of Mary Ann Shadd Cary\u2019s disagreement with him about how the community should fund a school that her outspokenness \u201cwill add nothing to her credit as a lady.\u201d273 Yee explains: \u201c[W]hile Black women\u2019s participation in community-building may have been considered an acceptable extension of women\u2019s domestic responsibility beyond the private household, those who did so found themselves in a delicate balancing act.\u201d274 If Black women social workers were too outspoken, their femininity and precarious toehold on respectability could be questioned \u2013 within a patriarchal understanding in which femininity and outspokenness were antithetical. Subjugated Community-Based Social Workings Beyond Black and White The relatively large number of Black people in what\u2019s now called Canada and the United States up to the periods we\u2019re discussing is a direct result of the transatlantic slave trade. The relatively small number of migrants from Asia and other parts of the world \u2013 through to the 1960s \u2013 is a direct result of exclusionary racist immigration policies. Due to these two white supremacist practices, there were many more Black people in what\u2019s now called the United States and Canada than any other racialized groups from the Global South. However, some people from Asia and other parts of the world did migrate here. As in Black and white communities, these communities also came together in new ways to meet needs that resulted from the massive demographic shifts occurring. Most of these communities\u2019 efforts have not been as extensively documented as those in white and Black communities, making tracing their histories difficult; but this scarce documentation doesn\u2019t mean they weren\u2019t actively involved in the diverse activities of social working. Some research exists on the Chinese community in British Columbia (BC). During the era when professional social work was born, Chinese folks in BC \u201corganiz[ed] a remarkable number of voluntary mutual aid fraternal associations, partly in response to the racial discrimination they suffered,\u201d beginning soon after they first arrived in Canada in the late 1850s.275 These groups organized to fight racism, provide social services within their own community, and facilitate conflict resolution. Mutual aid groups operated in Chinese communities in BC for about a century, and were integral to the community in the face of the tremendous racist hostilities that surrounded them.276 Around the same time, the Sikh community in BC worked collectively with other South Asians to provide food, housing, and jobs for those in need; lobby the government; and fight discrimination. Today, we would call this collection of activities \u201cnewcomer settlement social work,\u201d and it\u2019s basically exactly what white and Black social workers were providing and calling social work at the time. In 1907, the Vancouver Khalsa Diwan Society was established as a Sikh religious organizing body, but, according to Norman Buchignani, Doreen Indra, and Ram Srivastava, it \u201cquickly involved itself in matters of general [South Asian] community welfare and became the focal point for subsequent South Asian battles against discrimination.\u201d277 While the initial group was Sikh, it is said to have \u201cspoke[n] for all South Asian",

They considered the raising of funds and supplies from white people to be shameful, and they wanted Black communities to be self-sufficient. They also opposed the construction of Black settlements, calling for people to integrate into Canadian society. One of the strongest voices against collecting resources (\u201cbegging,\u201d as they called it) was Mary Ann Shadd Cary, who was active in Black community social services and media.221 Black communities also built formal institutions modelled after those imported from Europe through colonialism.222 For example, Nova Scotian orphanages and children\u2019s homes wouldn\u2019t admit Black children \u2013 resulting in them sometimes being put in asylums or on work farms.223 Therefore, under the leadership of James R. Johnston and the African United Baptists Association, the Nova Scotia Home for Coloured Children (NSHCC) opened in 1921.224 Due to systemic racial segregation in social services,225 this institution was incredibly important to the Black community. Its opening marked the largest gathering of Black people in Nova Scotia since 1783.226 The NSHCC is an example of the social work initiatives that Black communities undertook in Canada. Candice Roker discusses the \u201cpositive survival\u201d resistance to racist exclusion of Black people in Nova Scotia. She argues that the creation of the NSHCC \u201cis one of the most public examples of the African Nova Scotian community taking care of its own.\u201d227 The NSHCC retained its historical name but became racially integrated in the 1970s;228 it continued to operate as an orphanage until the late 1980s.229 Like so many institutions that house vulnerable children, including Indian residential schools and many institutions for disabled children,230 significant abuses took place at the NSHCC. In 1948, a social worker documented concerns about inadequate food for the children living in the NSHCC. Sexual abuse was documented in the 1980s, including the rape of a child, but no charges were ever laid.231 In 2001, a number of former residents of the home filed lawsuits for abuse,232 some of which dates back to as early as the 1940s.233 In 2014, the premier of Nova Scotia apologized for the abuse as part of a settlement with survivors, and a restorative inquiry was announced in 2015.234 Terrible things happened at this institution that should never happen to anyone. It is entirely possible abuse was present there from its early days. Yet, even then, we can hold this injustice in tension with an acknowledgment of the importance of what the Nova Scotian Black community did by building the home. Building a racially segregated institution, which seems to have been characterized by the same abuses of power as were found at other institutional sites, can be conceptualized as yet another instance of navigating the norms that were available at the time. Black Nova Scotians built for their community\u2019s children a resource often considered at that time indispensable for serving children in need. As in so many other institutions, many children were seriously harmed within its walls. There is frequently a tendency to view historical developments as either good or bad, but removing the NSHCC from \u201cgood\u201d anti-racist history and placing it into \u201cbad\u201d institutional history prevents us from struggling to cultivate a complex relationship with this fundamentally interlocking history and its legacies. Black communities navigated available norms, but didn\u2019t adopt all available norms. As a glaring example with tremendous relevance to contemporary social work, we found no historical record of any Black community in the United States or Canada establishing a child protection agency in which people from outside a family or community scrutinized parents and determined whether a child would be allowed to remain with them. In the extensive social welfare systems created by Black folks in Canada and the United States, we found no evidence of a single Black agency that practised involuntary child apprehension. White child protection agencies didn\u2019t normally* serve Black families until the end of legal racial segregation in the mid-twentieth century. Yet, even in cities with significant Black social welfare infrastructures, including women\u2019s clubs, settlement houses, and orphanages, it seems that no Black community practised child apprehension. (If we\u2019re wrong and one or two communities did so, it would have been extremely marginal considering that we\u2019ve encountered no trace of it.) Black and white social workers learned from one another and often worked together, developing similar (usually racially segregated) services, but Black social workers didn\u2019t practice child apprehension. In the only article we found exploring the fact that professional child welfare didn\u2019t operate in US Black communities until after legal racial segregation was abolished,\u2020 Jillian Jimenez writes: \u201cA shadow child welfare system [existed] that performed similar functions to the public child welfare system from which African American children were largely excluded.\u201d235 In apparently every Black community, people were left to do the work of \u201cchild protection\u201d and \u201cchild welfare\u201d using means that had been available to them before anybody had ever become a paid \u201csocial worker.\u201d In a recent interview about having won the Woman of Distinction Award, Black Canadian politician Zanana Akande was asked where her ethic of \u201ccontinuing to push\u201d for justice originated.

In the first half of the twentieth century in Black communities in the United States, the principal strategy for protecting children from abuse and neglect was community surveillance: \u201cthe extended family, especially grandmothers \u2026 aunts, great aunts, and older sisters \u2026 provided a concentric circle of approval and disapproval to support or criticize the child rearing practices of a child\u2019s primary caretakers.\u201d238 There were community-sanctioned interventions for when adults harmed children, which were rooted in community-specific hierarchies of moral and political authority. Older women relatives in Black America occupied the role only then being taken over in white America by paid ruling class strangers.

Yet, Carlton-LaNey asserts that \u201clower class women were also active in clubs and formed organizations in an effort to serve themselves and the needy in their communities.\u201d242 She writes that this class diversity among workers, as well as shared experiences of racism, helped these social workers more reflexively consider their own power: even educated Black social workers with \u201cproperty ownership, poise, and eloquence \u2026 [were often] treated like \u2018washerwomen\u2019 [which] \u2026 kept them attuned to the deplorable conditions to which their less-fortunate sisters were subjected.\u201d243 Through to the 1920s, \u201ca white woman in Halifax looking for help with her laundry felt free to stop any African-Nova Scotian woman on the street and request \u2018where she could get a good girl.\u2019\u201d244 White supremacy served to homogenize Blackness so that, in practice, it was the only relevant identifier in many cases, or at least it was the identity category that trumped all others. The assumption that any Black person would know where to get a cleaner in Halifax was based on the pervasive white supremacist association of Black people with domestic service and dirt. This thinking had important social significance and was intimately tied up with interlocking moral economies of human value. At this time, eugenics was often referred to as \u201cmental hygiene,\u201d245 and Ivory Soap boasted about its ability to \u201ccivilize\u201d Indigenous people.246 This period was also the era in which white ruling class women acquired an unprecedented degree of exalted bourgeois subjectivity. Fellows and Razack explain that dirt was important in constituting these select women as separate and distinct from \u2013 and to imagine themselves morally superior to \u2013 \u201cwasherwomen.\u201d247 The renegotiation of white ruling class women\u2019s positioning within largely unchanged moral economies of human value relied on the intensive and ongoing discursive denigration of others. Remaining racially devalued even with upward class mobility, Black social workers\u2019 experiences of continued discrimination, alongside the relative class diversity among Black service providers, seems to have mitigated the classism normally inherent to social work. Most Black women welfare reformers, according to Gordon, \u201cwere usually newly middle-class, perhaps a generation away from slavery and without much cushion against economic misfortune.\u201d248 These women were living a very different experience of being middle class than that of their white contemporaries.\n\nChapman, Chris; Withers, A.J..

Edi\u00e7\u00e3o do Kindle. contemporaries.249 Knupfer, in describing the Phyllis Wheatley Club in Chicago, therefore makes the case that \u201cbecause club women were well aware of the double burden of racism and sexism which all African-American women faced, more often than not they reached \u2018across\u2019 rather than \u2018down\u2019 to their less fortunate sisters.\u201d250 The club\u2019s social work was \u201cmutual and reciprocal\u201d between poor and middle class members.251 In addition to sharing experiences of anti-Black oppression, Carlton-LaNey notes that shared Black pride also \u201cserved as a mechanism for group solidarity and helped to undercut class differences.\u201d252 It seems that race mitigated the class oppression that early Black social workers exercised, as compared to white social work at the time. However, other scholars cite historical evidence of overt and insidious classism among Black social workers too. Many of the class biases that existed in the work of friendly visitors and other white charity work were also present among Black social work organizations. For example, urban Northern social workers who provided social services to migrants from the South often looked down upon the people they were trying to help. Martin and Martin say that Black social workers, like other urban Northern Americans, perceived the migrants as \u201cuncouth, unkempt, boisterous, and ignorant.\u201d253 Northern urban social workers, Black and white, therefore engaged in what Sheila Weiss calls an \u201ceffort of the middle class to mold the behavior of the migrants in its own image [which] was clearly a one-way process. There was never any hint that the black bourgeoisie had anything to learn from its newly arrived neighbors.\u201d254 Like many other well-meaning people working to affect social change, then and now, early Black social workers often seem to have believed they knew what was best for the people they worked with. But their ideas were often informed by classist moral economies. This classed outlook was evident, for example, when Black professor R.L. Smith of Oakwood, Texas, began community organizing to make his community more aesthetically pleasing in 1889.255 As a ruling class man, he understood the physical appearance of the village to be its most pressing need. It was only after a year, when only minor issues had been resolved and people didn\u2019t follow through on more major and expensive undertakings, that he began to wonder why the response had been so lukewarm. He realized it was because the people he was working with were poor. He concluded that \u201cwhat the Negro farmers of Texas and of the South really needed was not, at this stage, a Village Improvement Society.\u201d256 If Smith had facilitated a conversation about what the community needed and how it should go about achieving those needs at the initial meeting a year earlier, their efforts may have been much more productive. Having largely done nothing for the first year, Smith now set out to reduce poverty, alongside his own aim of getting people to improve their homes and yards. He helped organize a cooperative in which farmers in the area pooled their resources, enabling two important changes: buying in bulk (obtaining discounts for volume purchases) and avoiding the use of credit, which could mean substantial savings in interest payments. After the organization had been somewhat successful in helping farmers gain financial security, an organization called the Negro Cooperative Society was founded. Smith was a supporter of the Booker T. Washington \u2013 or liberal, rather than radical \u2013 school of Black activism, and he tied the ranks in the organization to how much people had saved. Only once someone achieved the twelfth degree, and was thus named \u201cGrand Patriarch,\u201d did they gain a vote at conference.257 The richest members of the cooperative society were granted exclusive voting rights, enabling them to direct the society regardless of support from its majority. Class hierarchy and bias drove this organizational design in a clear illustration of the material effects of moral economy: those already regarded superior tend to accumulate further moral (and thus political) capital. It\u2019s assumed that those who have saved the most money are most deserving and will know best. From there, a structure is built that allows those with the most political and moral capital to gain even more institutional political power \u2013 even in this \u201ccooperative.\u201d Indeed, a large cross-section of Black social workers supported Booker T. Washington\u2019s principles, which \u201cmeasure success by the ownership of land, homes, businesses, union membership, and bank accounts.\u201d258 The class status of most Black social workers, like most social workers in general, informed their values and understandings of the world. According to Peebles-Wilkins and Francis, \u201cThese women\u2019s ideals were [ruling class] American ideals.\u201d259 They accepted the dominant views of society, working to reform some systems of oppression while leaving others intact \u2013 especially capitalism. Peebles-Wilkins and Francis suggest that Black upwardly mobile social workers, such as Mary Church Terrell, \u201cespoused fundamental, traditional American values about family, the work ethic, social obligations, democracy, and freedom that she transmitted cross-culturally.\u201d They write: \u201cThe goals of black women activists focused on uplift and contained the overtones of social Darwinism,\u201d which was the assumed social good of unimpeded competition within existing social and political structures.260 Many Black social workers, like white ones, upheld capitalism, which, after all, was the economic system permitting their upward mobility. They worked towards cumulative individual racial uplift within the parameters of existing economic and moral systems, rather than working to overhaul the system for the benefit of those suffering the most from it. Many social workers, informed by liberal individualism and prevalent moral economies of race and class differentiation, directed their change efforts at individuals rather than the social structures that caused such differentiation. Cornelius Bynum reports that \u201cAfrican American elites largely accommodated white racist assumptions about black inferiority.\u201d261 Martin and Martin suggest that established residents of the urban North \u201cfeared that the newcomers would reinforce stereotypes of black people and stir up antiblack sentiments that would have dire consequences for all black people.\u201d262 While social workers worked to \u201chelp\u201d poor people, they also often worked to normalize and assimilate members of the Black community so that \u2013 like white ruling class women \u2013 they too might gain what Fellows and Razack call a toehold on respectability.263 When social workers did explicitly set out to address systemic issues, they became burnt out, claim Martin and Martin. As a result, in the end, \u201cthey focused their attention on trying to change the character of the victims of the dominant system, helping them to cope better with their oppression.\u201d264 Social work interventions were frequently about normalizing poor Black people and getting them to conform to middle class behaviours, aesthetics, and values.265 This form of social work involved many of the same interventions that the friendly visitors stressed: cleanliness, good housekeeping, temperance, thrift, and so on. The 1921 report of Cincinnati\u2019s Negro Civic Welfare Committee of the Council of Social Agencies demonstrates that the committee was incredibly condescending and paternalistic towards working class people and enacted capitalist indoctrination. The committee operated a workplace friendly visiting program involving over 800 Black women. \u201cShe goes and gives friendly advice on punctuality, regularity, efficiency, thrift, and tries to develop in them the proper attitude toward their work.\u201d266 This committee may well have advocated for workers, and the citation above may have been written to attract donations. Yet, the report depicts this social work organization as working to improve people\u2019s lives by helping them transform into more productive capitalist subjects, something that did nothing to improve the institutionalized social, economic, political, and moral barriers they experienced. We\u2019re not saying that any of the work of early Black social workers shouldn\u2019t have been done. Rather, we can all uniquely interrogate the complexities of the past in order to better understand and interrupt patterns we may continue to replicate, uniquely positioned as each one of us is within these legacies. As bell hooks says, \u201cInterlocking systems [of oppression] indict us all in some way.\u201d267 Early Women Social Workers and Gender Roles Working to ameliorate some of the harshness caused by capitalism while upholding the system itself is similar to how many early women social workers \u2013 Black and white \u2013 approached gender. Separate spheres discourse was incredibly oppressive for women. Yet, its specific contours and divisions also created possibilities for women to take up leadership roles in what came to be called social work. Women encroached into public spaces by intervening into others\u2019 private spheres. As is true of all communities, Black women responded to gendered expectations in diverse ways. Mary Church Terrell, the honorary lifetime president of the National Association of Colored Women (NACW), largely supported separate spheres.268 However, Maggie Walker was adamantly and publicly opposed to separate spheres. Writing in 1912, she argued: \u201cThere is neither justice or good common sense in the demand that every woman should confine her activities to the domestic duties of home . . . As ability, adaptability decide these things for men, so let them decide for woman.\u201d269 Walker, the first woman bank president in the United States, supported equal rights for women, which included for her the abolition of the mores of gendered separate spheres. Furthermore, regardless of their own navigation of separate spheres, many early Black social workers advocated for suffrage and gender equality,* including Mary Ann Shadd Cary,270 Mary Church Terrell, Ida B. Wells-Barnett,271 and Maggie Walker.272 Women exposed themselves to the risks of men\u2019s patriarchal moralizing when they became active in the public sphere. For example, Henry Bibb said of Mary Ann Shadd Cary\u2019s disagreement with him about how the community should fund a school that her outspokenness \u201cwill add nothing to her credit as a lady.\u201d273 Yee explains: \u201c[W]hile Black women\u2019s participation in community-building may have been considered an acceptable extension of women\u2019s domestic responsibility beyond the private household, those who did so found themselves in a delicate balancing act.\u201d274 If Black women social workers were too outspoken, their femininity and precarious toehold on respectability could be questioned \u2013 within a patriarchal understanding in which femininity and outspokenness were antithetical. Subjugated Community-Based Social Workings Beyond Black and White The relatively large number of Black people in what\u2019s now called Canada and the United States up to the periods we\u2019re discussing is a direct result of the transatlantic slave trade. The relatively small number of migrants from Asia and other parts of the world \u2013 through to the 1960s \u2013 is a direct result of exclusionary racist immigration policies. Due to these two white supremacist practices, there were many more Black people in what\u2019s now called the United States and Canada than any other racialized groups from the Global South. However, some people from Asia and other parts of the world did migrate here. As in Black and white communities, these communities also came together in new ways to meet needs that resulted from the massive demographic shifts occurring. Most of these communities\u2019 efforts have not been as extensively documented as those in white and Black communities, making tracing their histories difficult; but this scarce documentation doesn\u2019t mean they weren\u2019t actively involved in the diverse activities of social working. Some research exists on the Chinese community in British Columbia (BC). During the era when professional social work was born, Chinese folks in BC \u201corganiz[ed] a remarkable number of voluntary mutual aid fraternal associations, partly in response to the racial discrimination they suffered,\u201d beginning soon after they first arrived in Canada in the late 1850s.275 These groups organized to fight racism, provide social services within their own community, and facilitate conflict resolution. Mutual aid groups operated in Chinese communities in BC for about a century, and were integral to the community in the face of the tremendous racist hostilities that surrounded them.276 Around the same time, the Sikh community in BC worked collectively with other South Asians to provide food, housing, and jobs for those in need; lobby the government; and fight discrimination. Today, we would call this collection of activities \u201cnewcomer settlement social work,\u201d and it\u2019s basically exactly what white and Black social workers were providing and calling social work at the time. In 1907, the Vancouver Khalsa Diwan Society was established as a Sikh religious organizing body, but, according to Norman Buchignani, Doreen Indra, and Ram Srivastava, it \u201cquickly involved itself in matters of general [South Asian] community welfare and became the focal point for subsequent South Asian battles against discrimination.\u201d277 While the initial group was Sikh, it is said to have \u201cspoke[n] for all South Asian\n\nChapman, Chris; Withers, A.J.. A Violent History of Benevolence: Interlocking Oppression in the Moral Economies of Social Working (pp. 115-120). University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division. Edi\u00e7\u00e3o do Kindle. Canadians regardless of religion.\u201d278 Because of this inclusivity, \u201cSouth Asian Muslims and Hindus \u2026 contributed money and labour to building the Vancouver Sikh temple, for they saw it as a secular rallying point for everyone from \u2018Hindustan.\u2019\u201d279 Together, they organized against British imperial rule in South Asia and Canadian government plans to deport South Asians.280 \u201cOver the next ten years South Asians battled continuously against racial subordination. In the process they developed a set of community institutions that were remarkable given the circumstances.\u201d281 Diverse Indigenous nations and communities were also actively social working throughout this period. Folks drew on long-standing traditions of mutual aid and resisted the ongoing colonial project, which specifically aimed at displacing cultural practices of sharing and helping by imposing capitalist economic systems onto Indigenous nations. In these circumstances, working against colonialism to fight assimilation and preserve traditions of helping were important interventions into the social world.282 Other Indigenous interventions into the social world at the time, which fall outside the standard account of social work history, are the many ways that parents, elders, and community members organized to prevent their children from being apprehended by the state and tried to incite change when they heard about the abuse their children were subjected to.283 The centrality of the conflict between Richmond and Addams has become standard in envisioning what social work was, is, and can be. Yet, situating the conflict between the \u201cchild protection\u201d efforts of Indigenous families, on the one hand, and the \u201cchild protection\u201d work of Indian residential schools and children\u2019s aid societies, on the other hand, as another way of thinking about the parameters and possibilities of social work would open up very different understandings of what \u201csocial work\u201d is and can be. Recently, Indigenous practices such as restorative justice are beginning to be incorporated into contemporary professional social work.284 But, as we make such much-needed changes, we should be careful to avoid telling accounts of social work history that minimize the violence with which such practices have been \u2013 and continue to be \u2013 displaced and supplanted with traditions and practices from Europe and white settler communities. Recognition of that violent suppression is part of the work of decolonization too. We also need to be cautious about exactly how Indigenous practices and traditions get incorporated. As Chris has written of their work in a colonial and disablist institution that \u201cincorporated the medicine wheel and a talking feather into our life-skills curricula,\u201d these inclusions were never permitted to interfere with institutional efficiency and violence. They \u201cwere removed from their original contexts and pasted into our institutional one, redeployed in such a way as to extend the status quo operations of institutionalization and enculturation.\u201d285 Indigenous practices can be significant in the shift towards more just and dignified possible ways for humans to come together in what is called social work,286 as can the work of countless other communities that have had their practices displaced, marginalized, and subjugated by professional social work. However, these practices should never be cut and pasted into otherwise unchanged white social work. Rather, we need to fundamentally transform the narrow and hierarchical norms and mores that are now institutionalized. The history we provide in this chapter is nowhere near complete. The diversity of examples of social work that sprang up in response to specific community concerns around the turn of the last century exceeds the number of communities that existed at the time. Social work in distinct communities looked different from one another because those communities, and their beliefs, needs, and resources, were different from one another. Such diversity \u2013 then and now \u2013 could function as an important resource for social workers today, but only if we know to look for it at all. Conclusion We have given a brief overview of early social work in the United States and Canada, focusing on Black social work because of the existing scholarship on the breadth of activities and the obvious erasures of sometimes identical activities as those included within white social work history. Presumably, like the majority of those in the helping professions today, most Black social workers at the time worked largely out of the public eye, and so their contributions will forever remain unknown to history. Community organizing and social movements are made up of many people who all make important contributions, but when these activities are recorded in history, the collectivities get translated through individualism into remarkable heroes who bravely led the way.287 This tendency alone, though, doesn\u2019t account for why so little is known within social work scholarship about Black community and social service work a century ago. Many Black leaders \u2013 such as Wells, Du Bois, and Walker \u2013 were famous around 1900 for their many interventions into the social world. And, of course, we\u2019ve clearly left countless other well-known Black figures out of this history. It\u2019s simply untrue that social work emerged only out of British and white settler efforts, as the standard account would have it. Yet, that false history continues to have concrete effects today. Because the standard account is told the way it is, radical social work scholar Mimi Abramovitz can critique that, due to \u201cracism and segregation, the settlements and the networks established by African American women never became well known or exercised much influence outside the African American community.\u201d288 While this assessment is not entirely untrue, it erases what influence they did have and the prominence some historical Black folks held, and it doesn\u2019t consider whether white folks like Addams might have been directly influenced by the sometimes earlier Black efforts. Yet, what is perhaps even more troubling is that Abramovitz can acknowledge the influence of racism and still also write, as a summary of \u201cthe history of social work,\u201d that the \u201csocial change-oriented Settlement House Movement (SHM) vied for control of the emerging profession with the older and more individually oriented Charity Organization Society (COS). This initial conflict \u2026 anticipated a century of struggle.\u201d289 We are struck by the incongruity of adding the fact that racism shaped history to that very tradition of history without reshaping the priorities which inform its telling as a result of this fact. Social work struggles with personal versus political change, certainly, but why should that particular conflict be the guiding framework for all social work history? Or why should that struggle be represented by the COS versus white settlements? Another history of social work could present the primary tension as that of the liberal Booker T. Washington camp versus the radical W.E.B. Du Bois camp, or the liberal Maggie Walker camp versus the radical Ida B. Wells camp. Like centring the conflict between Richmond and Addams, these framings would describe the tension between advocating for reform within a largely unchanged system versus working to fundamentally transform the system. Even more transformative, as suggested earlier, would be if we honoured the \u201cchild protection\u201d work done in Black communities with no institutionalized child protective services, alongside that done in Indigenous communities struggling to save their children from externally imposed professional \u201cprotection,\u201d and we took such widely diverse work as a counterpoint to the work that became institutionalized as white child protective services and Indian residential schooling. This ongoing struggle of communities taking care of their own versus external imposition is a fundamental tension that has always existed in \u201csocial work practice\u201d \u2013 and honouring or centring it might significantly shift the ways we think and feel about what we do. Maybe it would even transform what we tend to do. In their history of what they call \u201cradical social work,\u201d Michael Reisch and Janice Andrews discuss some of the work of Black organizers during the Progressive Era. However, they repeatedly make white people the reference point. For example, they write: \u201cSome early radical social workers were far more willing than their mainstream counterparts to work cooperatively with people of color and to participate in inter-racial organizations or multiracial coalitions.\u201d290 Here, the category \u201cradical social workers\u201d is represented as white. They go on to mention the work of (unnamed) Black women organizers and then emphasize Jane Addams\u2019s role in anti-racist organizing. Such representations continue to inform imaginaries of who (radical) social workers are today. While American histories of Black social work are much more concrete and accessible than Canadian ones,291 plenty of interventions into the social world in 1800s Black Ontario and Nova Scotia are well documented. These stories are not entirely hidden \u2013 the work of anti-slavery societies and Black colonizers are often disseminated during Black History Month. The opening of the Nova Scotia Home for Coloured Children brought out the biggest gathering of Black Nova Scotians in over a century,292 and one of its founders, James Johnston, had the largest funeral in Halifax since the death of Sir John S.D. Thompson, Canada\u2019s fourth prime minister, two decades earlier.293 These events were not marginal. How do they become and remain marginal stories when history gets written? Black social workers were clearly influenced by what was going on in white social work.294 Without a doubt, that\u2019s true. But white social workers were also influenced by Black social workers,295 and this reciprocity isn\u2019t acknowledged in the standard account. Most of the histories of Black social work we\u2019ve drawn upon make mention of white social work, especially of Jane Addams and her work.296 Racialized social work authors are required to demonstrate their fluency in white social work history, but white social work historians don\u2019t need to prove their credentials in relation to Black histories or any other histories outside of white settler and European communities. This double standard is due to the moral economy of white supremacy continuing to shape what gets known and done. Discussing Black social work educator and social worker George Haynes\u2019s view that Black social workers needed to learn Black history, Martin and Martin write that Haynes felt Black people are \u201cboth creatures and creators of history in that history has placed them where they are right now and has shaped their point of view, their identity, and their aspirations.\u201d297 This description is particularly true of Black people in the context of white supremacist American and Canadian history, but it can also be said to be true in site-specific ways for all of us. We are all \u201ccreatures and creators of history\u201d; history shapes what we can think, perceive, feel, do, and be \u2013 not only because of which past events occurred, but also because of which past events get told, how they\u2019re framed, from whose perspective they\u2019re told, and who gets represented as significant in their development. The exclusion of Black and racialized social workers from the standard account of social work history is a product of white supremacy, and it replicates social work as a white institution, naturalizing white people in the role of social worker and making social workers of colour seem aberrational even today. Histories centre certain figures and decentre others. Addams, a white woman, is centred while Wells and Walker are decentred. This act of narrative exaltation and marginalization has real consequences. Consider the following: Karen Lundblad writes, \u201cAs a social reformer and organizer, Addams is almost unparalleled \u2026 [and] remains an inspiration and role model for social workers today.\u201d298 We admire Addams for her work and her mind. She is indeed an inspiration. Yet, what does it mean to frame her as \u201calmost unparalleled\u201d if we consider the Black women who fought for social change, benefited their communities, and contributed to the helping professions as a whole? Further salt is added to the wound when claims of Addams\u2019s uniqueness are evidenced by her relationship with Wells, Du Bois, and other Black activists. What\u2019s forgotten is that she gravitated to them as inspirational, at the very same time as they gravitated to her. She wasn\u2019t the only inspiration in those relationships. And she doesn\u2019t have to be the only one available to us today.

Rather than deeply reflecting on her position, this white person in a leadership position, and the organization under her direction, dug in their heels and refused to acknowledge the harm they\u2019d caused. The white people thus claimed their own innocence143 and, worse still, depicted themselves as wronged for having been accused of racism. The implication is that the Black community organizers who challenged the organization\u2019s position were overreacting, too sensitive, and too angry \u2013 all of which reaffirms white supremacist anti-Black stereotypes. For this reason, these stories of Wells, Willard, and Addams are not only important as history but also as examples of how people today who claim to be allies need to be reflexive and of when they should defer to the lead of those most directly affected by an issue. Our aim here, with respect to Addams and Willard, is to paint a more complex picture of them \u2013 particularly of Addams. We\u2019re all formed by discourses, practices, and moral economies of interlocking oppression. They shape what we can know, believe, and perceive. It\u2019s not that this shaping is out of the realm of our influence or that either woman is innocent. Recognizing these complexities and holding their positive anti-oppressive practice in tension with the clearly racist, classist, and otherwise oppressive things they did is useful in helping us all understand that we\u2019re complicit in oppression even when working against it. Acknowledging this complicity is a crucial part of critical or anti-oppressive practice.144 Early Black social workers were not perfect either. Like everyone else, they were flawed people with imperfect politics who sometimes did oppressive things and often held problematic views about other people. They were part of the project of social work\u2019s new and politically complicated interventions into the social world, and sometimes this project brought an increase in surveillance, assimilation, classism, cisheterosexism, and social control into Black communities. We don\u2019t want to paint a picture of any of these figures as perfect, because we can only follow in the footsteps of the types of people that we know to have existed. As Davis asks of representations of Martin Luther King, Jr: \u201cHow could you possibly measure up to someone like that?\u201d145 She stresses that the Montgomery bus boycott \u2013 widely considered the birth of the civil rights movement \u2013 was started by ordinary people just like any one of us, and she emphasizes how important it is for us to know this in order to open possibilities for considering what role we might play in fundamental social transformation. Maggie L. Walker and the Independent Order of St Luke Maggie L. Walker\u2019s record of significantly intervening into the social world begins with her participation in what is believed to be the first anti-segregation school strike by Black students in the United States in 1883. She went on to become a teacher and part-time worker at an insurance company and later was hired as the secretary for the Independent Order of St Luke in Richmond, Virginia. The order had been founded in 1867 by former slave Mary Prout in Baltimore.146 Lily Hardy Hammond, writing in 1922, describes the Order of St Luke when Walker first came on board as \u201ca little benefit society in Richmond \u2013 one of probably a dozen or two,\u201d which had around 1,000 members. These societies were commonplace in Black communities where \u201csickness [was] a catastrophe such as only the poorest people can fully comprehend.\u201d The society paid its members out of dues if a member became sick or died, \u201cthus saving the family from what is often, among the very poor, a crushing burden of debt.\u201d147 At a time when nation-states were just beginning to offer workers\u2019 compensation themselves, local collective organizations, included this one started by Prout, acted as a social safety net. Working class people, including Black people and recent immigrants, would cumulatively contribute to a fund, and the collective would then support them from that fund if they needed it.148 The gradual development of private disability, workers\u2019 compensation, and life insurance are commonly described as contributing to the development of the modern welfare state and as a key part of social work history.149 Walker worked to expand services; by 1922, there were 100,000 members with the organization across twenty-one states. Walker also started the St Luke\u2019s Herald, which provided community and organizational news, and covered topics that preoccupied social work publications of the day such as \u201chealth, thrift, morals, and education.\u201d150 The Herald also provided detailed accounts of lynchings, segregation, and racism. The order adopted political positions, including supporting universal suffrage and anti-lynching efforts. It led the Richmond streetcar boycott against segregation in 1904.151 The Independent Order of St Luke created a bank in 1903 under Walker\u2019s direction. Walker thus became the first woman president of a bank in the United States. The bank provided financing for Black people to buy homes and go to college, among other things.152 These funds would have been otherwise difficult or impossible for Black people in the South to obtain. The predominantly circulated history of the credit union is that it was spread by Desjardins to the United States in 1908.153 Credit unions began in Germany, and had begun to be established in Qu\u00e9bec by Alphonse Desjardins in 1900 to help low-income people secure credit. Walker\u2019s bank seems to have been aligned with the ethos of early collectivist credit unions. When such work is undertaken by a disadvantaged racialized group to provide services for those who couldn\u2019t otherwise access them due to racial segregation and rampant poverty, it is a significant intervention into the social world, enabling people to better navigate and mitigate capitalism\u2019s violences. In 1909, Walker wrote that she wished to \u201cturn the course of that almighty stream of dollar, and see if we can till our own barren lands, feed our own hungry, and clothe our own naked.\u201d154 Yet, this bank is not considered part of credit union history. Like many other early women social workers of her time, Walker was also involved in club work. She founded a Richmond Council of Colored Women, which did community service and fundraising.155 When given the opportunity, Walker and other community members fundraised to establish a home for young women, with help from a white philanthropist. According to Walker, \u201cThe white philanthropist \u2026 said that if we colored women would show our interest in social work among our people by raising a thousand dollars for it, he would give us the use of a large house, and if we made good, he would deed it to a board of white and colored women for colored work.\u201d156 In response to this possibility, the community raised the money, and the women established the home. Walker said that white women in Richmond \u201chad done fine community work for white people,\u201d but that, with respect to this project, \u201cthe white women don\u2019t work for us, \u2013 they work with us.\u201d157 Walker worked with whomever was necessary, doing whatever was necessary, to help the Black community of Richmond and, indeed, the whole country. However, if you check the index of any social work text that is not specifically about Black social work, it is almost guaranteed that you won\u2019t find her name there. The Social Work Profession, Social Science, and Education Through the Progressive Era, many professions were not accessible to Black people in Canada and the United States because of the racist, segregationist educational and economic systems. Francille Wilson writes that the only two professions open to Black people were \u201cteaching and preaching,\u201d158 neither of which required a degree at the time. Social work had the potential to be yet another accessible profession for Black people,159 given that it was outside the systems of governing accredited bodies and academic programs (unlike law and medicine, by this time). Decent paid jobs were frequently obtainable for Black social workers in a number of social sectors, although often in segregated agencies or departments.160 The availability of social work jobs may, in part, explain why an increasing number of Black (and white) men entered the profession, which had previously been considered women\u2019s work.161 In fact, differentiating social work from charity often mapped onto differentiating the work that men were doing from that which women had been doing previously.162 An increasing emphasis on the use of social science was present in Black social work at the time. In the late nineteenth century, W.E.B. Du Bois started doing sociological studies of Black communities that served to identify their needs and combat racist notions about them.163 Some social science emphasized the desire to take social work out of the hands of the churches,164 but social science was taken up by social gospellers as well.165 As in white social work, a belief in the importance of systematic and scientific social work was commonly held by Black social workers across the political spectrum during this period.166 Black social workers also developed social work educational programs, with the first undergraduate program beginning in 1911.167 George Haynes, co-founder of the National Urban League (discussed earlier), established the program at Fisk University and advocated that an understanding of Black history was necessary for Black people to conduct effective Black social work.168 Haynes was motivated by the desire to ensure that Black service users were served by Black workers and that Black social workers did not become a professional underclass because they had fewer academic credentials.169 The first social work graduate program at a Black educational institution was established in 1922 at Atlanta\u2019s Morehouse College,170 and several other programs were created around the same time.171 Although social work programs had previously been available in white institutions, they did not teach from a Black perspective or address needs that were considered important in Black communities. Black Social Work in Canada Black social work in Canada has a number of similarities to the US history: churches played a major role in community work, reform efforts, and charity; there was a strong tradition of neighbour-to-neighbour helping and community improvement; and women took on important organizing roles, particularly with respect to schools and anti-slavery organizing.172 However, because Black communities were so much smaller in Canada than in the United States, and because of other factors such as political economy, geography, and climate, there were important differences too. The level of formal organization that occurred in the United States was simply not present in Canadian Black communities during the Progressive Era.173 Nonetheless, Black social work and social workers made important contributions to their communities and to the emerging profession of social work. Canada had a significant Black population for a number of reasons, including its own legacy of slavery, which began in 1628 when the first African slave was brought to what is now called Canada.174 The main sources of Black immigrants to Canada were slaves who accompanied British loyalists during the American Revolution, escaped slaves from Jamaica (known as the Maroons), freemen after the War of 1812, escaped American slaves through the Underground Railroad, and free US Black people trying to avoid American racism.175 Black communities in Canada during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were largely found in Ontario (called Upper Canada, Canada West, and the Province of Canada at various times) and Nova Scotia,176 although there were also notable populations on Vancouver Island177 and in Montr\u00e9al178 and several smaller cities.179 This settlement pattern was largely a product of the proximity of these English-speaking areas to the United States. Some Black settlers also migrated to the western provinces, but the government instituted anti-Black immigration policies before their numbers could rise significantly, as we discuss in chapter 4.180 Many US regions where Black people were legally \u201cfree\u201d had Black Laws or Black Codes, which seriously restricted the freedom and ability of many Black people to settle. This legal framework was yet another reason some Black people immigrated to Canada.181 In 1850, the US government passed the Fugitive Slave Act, allowing for the arrest of any escaped slave anywhere in the United States and requiring that person\u2019s return to their former \u201cowner.\u201d182 In the years following the passage of this act, around 50,000 former slaves* immigrated to Upper Canada.183 (To provide some perspective, the population of Toronto, called York at the time, was only 100,000 in 1841.184) Settlements in Canada A number of settlements were intentionally established as communities for escaped slaves and other Black people seeking a better life outside the pervasive and institutional racism of the United States. While this organizing has not been traditionally depicted as social work, those responsible for these initiatives were clearly engaged in making individuals\u2019 lives better,\n\nChapman, Chris; Withers, A.J.. A Violent History of Benevolence: Interlocking Oppression in the Moral Economies of Social Working (pp. 101-105). University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division. Edi\u00e7\u00e3o do Kindle. strengthening their communities, and undertaking many efforts that would later be called social work when white people did the same things for recent immigrants from Europe. It should be noted, though, that in spite of Canada\u2019s depiction as a refuge for Black people, many were surprised to find extreme racism in Canada as well.185 This hostility, as well as the difficulty of living off the land, meant that most people in the settlements had very difficult lives. A group of Black people who lived in Cincinnati organized to leave the city and travel to Canada in 1829. Cincinnati was a trading hub with the South, and white power brokers ensured that it was inhospitable to Black people.186 The city enforced the state\u2019s Black Laws, requiring, among other things, that new Black residents pay a $500 bond to ensure that they would be of good behaviour.187 In 1829, massive anti-Black race riots took place in Cincinnati. In an attempt to quell the violence and protect their families and property, about 300 Black men agreed to a government plan to voluntarily go to jail.188 This removal of adult men from the community did not quell the white attacks. However, according to Woodson, when the rioting ended, a number of the men who had surrendered themselves \u201cwere discharged on certificates of nativity, others gave bond for their support and good behavior, a few were dismissed as non-residents, a number of them were discharged by a justice of the Court of Common Pleas, and the rest were held indefinitely.\u201d189 Black men who had voluntarily agreed to be incarcerated in the hopes of staving off white violence were forced into forms of bail bonds, driven from the city, or indefinitely imprisoned. Prior to this incident, a group of local organizers had been planning to create a community in Ontario. The organizers likely chose an isolated rural area because they wanted to protect their community from white racism and aspired to achieve economic self-sufficiency.190 The numbers swelled after the riot; somewhere between 460 and 2,000 people fled to Canada. They settled in a community they called Wilberforce, near London, Ontario.191 Over the next decade, a school, stores, and farms were established. Wilberforce is depicted as a failure in the historical literature, but Nikki Taylor notes that the settlement met its original goal of independence.192 One of the reasons it was ultimately unsustainable was that the Canada Land Company, the Crown corporation that sold land to settlers, stopped selling land to Black settlers due to protests from white settlers in the region and the common white supremacist belief that Black people were not reliable enough to uphold their contracts.* In comparison to other settlements, Wilberforce was thus quite short lived. Yet, it provided an escape for many people fleeing racist violence and the Black Codes. Another settlement established near Windsor by the Refugee Home Society was founded in 1851,193 the year after the Fugitive Slave Act was passed and a mass exodus from the United States to Canada began in response. The Refugee Home Society offered a land-granting program with a systematic approach for providing assistance. Fugitive slaves were granted land (twenty-five acres, five acres of which were free). Settlers were then given nine years to pay for the remaining land, and the profits from the venture went into operating a school and continuing the organization\u2019s work, such as buying more land.194 One of the men credited with founding the Refugee Home Society is Henry Bibb. According to Fred Landon, Bibb believed that \u201cthe future of the people of color in Canada depended upon getting them settled on the land and his mind turned to the possibilities of establishing a distinctly Negro colony.\u201d195 For Bibb and the many Black people who lived in, organized, and supported Black colonies, this venture was a liberatory project. For the people who found refuge in Canada, it was also a liberatory project. Yet, while this designation is straightforwardly true, these Black people were also setting up colonies within a white settler colony. Celebrating Bibb in 1920, Landon titled his article \u201cHenry Bibb, a Colonizer.\u201d Bibb saw his chance for freedom for himself and his community as an active part of the colonial process. What was justice for his community helped sustain an injustice for another. Noticing how this one intensely oppressed group was complicit in the oppression of Indigenous people is, by no means, an attempt to undermine the horrors of slavery, including kidnapping, rape, enslavement, torture, and murder. Escaped slaves and other Black people were not wrong to flee to Canada. It was necessary for self-preservation, born of a context in which Black people had mostly come to the Americas through the brutality of the transatlantic slave trade. Bibb\u2019s colonizing can therefore be clearly distinguished from Europeans\u2019 choice to become part of the colonial project. However, it complicates things that former slaves adopted the role of settler. As Sunera Thobani describes, the colonial context of Canada (and the United States) results in any settlement and citizenship being complicit in the continued dispossession of Indigenous peoples\u2019 lands and sovereignty.196 Importantly, she notes this complicity alongside a careful study of the racism experienced by racialized immigrants in Canada, and she suggests that unless fundamental change is made at the level of what the nation is and its relationship to Indigenous communities and nations, the colonial complicity of all settlers remains an unresolvable dilemma. Mahmood says that agency lies not only in resisting social norms but also in how one inhabits norms. Whether in relation to Black women following the mores of separate spheres or escaped slaves taking up the work of colonization, clearly only so many options were available to long-denigrated peoples to enable them to survive and perform respectability. They may have reinforced oppressive mores and underlying moral economies of human value by doing what they did, but perhaps this contradiction might serve to invite us to reflect upon how each of us today uniquely inhabits oppressive mores, outside the simple framings of resistance versus complicity.197 Like many others, Bibb escaped slavery by becoming a colonizer. To complicate matters even further, the \u201cowner\u201d from whom he escaped was Indigenous.* Bibb wrote of his former slave master: \u201cHe was the most reasonable, and humane slaveholder that I have ever belonged to.\u201d He wrote that he would rather be owned by an Indigenous person than a white person.198 Yet, he was nevertheless this other man\u2019s legal property. Encouraging slave ownership was a US government tactic of assimilating Indigenous people in the South;199 it was a way Indigenous people were encouraged to inhabit \u201ccivilized\u201d mores. Certainly, some Indigenous people having owned slaves does nothing to cancel out or trump colonial injustices. Furthermore, Indigenous nations\u2019 responses to Black slavery were as diverse as the nations themselves. The Cherokee nation is said to have engaged in the most extensive Black slave ownership of all Indigenous groups: by the 1860s, the 17,000 members of the Cherokee nation owned 4,000 Black slaves.\u2020 The Seminole and Tuscarora nations, in contrast, provided safe haven for escaped slaves, resulting in many mixed relationships.200 Indigenous people had also been forced into slavery by Europeans and white settlers, starting with Columbus in 1492.201 Alan Gallay estimates that the British were involved in the slave trade of 30,000 to 50,000 Indigenous people in the United States by 1715.202 The practice of enslaving Indigenous people, however, was largely abandoned in the United States by 1720, in part because of militant resistance on the part of Indigenous nations.203 In telling Bibb\u2019s story, we hope to invite consideration of just how complex these histories are, rather than point fingers here or there. Bibb was a fugitive slave who, like so many slaves, was the son of a slave mother and a white father,204 and was likely conceived through the rape of his mother. He had been owned by a First Nations man on colonized land. Bibb escaped when his Indigenous master died, and went on to become a colonizer, purchasing land from the same British Crown that had stolen the land from Indigenous peoples across what\u2019s now called Canada and the United States. He did so to provide safe haven for other escaped slaves. Bibb was a social worker who contributed to founding an organization that helped his community secure basic freedom, education, and security. Bibb\u2019s story illustrates the intensity with which histories of slavery, colonialism, patriarchy, and social work interlock. When this social worker intervened in one political problem that was most pressing for him, he couldn\u2019t help but actively participate in another. Perhaps, in limitless variations, this complexity is the history of social work. Anti-Slavery Societies and Black Immigrant Assistance The earliest Black social work focused largely on assisting people who escaped slavery and fled to Canada, often with no money, no food, and no spare clothing. Rather than imagining this work to be exceptionally \u201cparticular\u201d to Black communities and therefore irrelevant to the subsequent development of social work more generally, we should look on it as work that helped to meet the needs of a group of people who were struggling as a result of unjust social conditions (as can be said of many social workings today and in the past). There was no state assistance for fugitive slaves (with the exception of Black people who emigrated after the War of 1812 and had assisted the British forces, who were given land).205 In response to this socially constituted need, a massive voluntary effort was undertaken to assist escaped slaves, which involved Black and white people collaborating in anti-slavery and liberation societies.206 These groups helped people find jobs, provided food and other resources, and more generally did the work that would later be called social work when undertaken in an organized way within poor white migrant communities. They also crossed national boundaries, just as later professional social work would do;207 for example, the American Anti-Slavery Society sent agents across the border to Canada to assist escaped slaves.208 These organizations fostered an ethos of mutual aid. Many of the people providing and organizing support were escaped slaves who had established themselves in Canada.209 Organizations like the Fugitives\u2019 Home and the Windsor Anti-Slavery Society were founded and run by fugitive slaves determined to assist other fugitives.210 Several were run by Black women, including the Ladies Freedman\u2019s Aid Society, the Ladies Colored Fugitive Association, and the Toronto Ladies\u2019 Association for the Relief of Destitute Colored Fugitives.211 Sharing the sensibility of what would soon be called social work, these organizations often believed that indiscriminate relief was bad and that aid should be restricted and controlled. For instance, the 1853 report of the Canada Anti-Slavery Society says: \u201cAll that able-bodied men and women require is a fair chance, friendly advice, and a little encouragement, perhaps a little assistance at first. Those who are really willing to work can procure employment in a short time after their arrival.\u201d212 While the fugitive relief effort was carried out on a massive scale, individual aid was often restricted, due to prevalent discourses of liberalism, capitalism, and scientific charity. It also bears repeating, yet again, that such relief efforts later run by white people for recent immigrants from Europe is called the origin of social work. Social Services A number of social work and social service projects were organized by members of Black communities in order to assist others in their communities. While some white people were also involved in helping escaped slaves, charitable and social services were segregated in Canada. Edward Lee and Ilyan Ferrer describe \u201csystemic exclusion from white social work institutions\u201d for the Black community.213 They also argue that \u201cthe exclusionary logic of the colour line was reflective of how communities of colour were racially segregated within the Canadian urban geography and provides further explanation as to why they were unable to access the white dominant charity or social settlement movements.\u201d The community building, aid, organizing, and advocacy that Black people did (and continue to do) are very clearly within the realm of what is considered social work, even though it has not been recognized as such in social work history: Elizabeth Jackson Shadd Shreve travelled through Southern Ontario forests to visit sick people and deliver food and clothing to those without;214 and Black people created youth groups, housing cooperatives, and political organizations like the Nova Scotia Association for the Advancement of Coloured People and the National Black Coalition in Nova Scotia.215 Benevolence clubs were also an important site of social service delivery and community building. One of the most prominent was called the True Band Society, which organized to create Black community self-sufficiency.216 The first True Band was founded in Amherstburg, Ontario (near Windsor), in 1854.217 Like the Provincial Union Association founded the same year, it worked to create and support Black community self-sufficiency.218 The True Bands provided resources to poor Black families, provided care for sick people, supported schools, and worked to resolve conflicts among community members.219 By 1856, there were\n\nChapman, Chris; Withers, A.J.. A Violent History of Benevolence: Interlocking Oppression in the Moral Economies of Social Working (pp. 105-110). University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division. Edi\u00e7\u00e3o do Kindle. fourteen True Band organizations with 600 members.220 Both the Provincial Union and the True Bands formed out of critiques about the work of groups like the Refugee Home Society and people like Henry Bibb. They considered the raising of funds and supplies from white people to be shameful, and they wanted Black communities to be self-sufficient. They also opposed the construction of Black settlements, calling for people to integrate into Canadian society. One of the strongest voices against collecting resources (\u201cbegging,\u201d as they called it) was Mary Ann Shadd Cary, who was active in Black community social services and media.221 Black communities also built formal institutions modelled after those imported from Europe through colonialism.222 For example, Nova Scotian orphanages and children\u2019s homes wouldn\u2019t admit Black children \u2013 resulting in them sometimes being put in asylums or on work farms.223 Therefore, under the leadership of James R. Johnston and the African United Baptists Association, the Nova Scotia Home for Coloured Children (NSHCC) opened in 1921.224 Due to systemic racial segregation in social services,225 this institution was incredibly important to the Black community. Its opening marked the largest gathering of Black people in Nova Scotia since 1783.226 The NSHCC is an example of the social work initiatives that Black communities undertook in Canada. Candice Roker discusses the \u201cpositive survival\u201d resistance to racist exclusion of Black people in Nova Scotia. She argues that the creation of the NSHCC \u201cis one of the most public examples of the African Nova Scotian community taking care of its own.\u201d227 The NSHCC retained its historical name but became racially integrated in the 1970s;228 it continued to operate as an orphanage until the late 1980s.229 Like so many institutions that house vulnerable children, including Indian residential schools and many institutions for disabled children,230 significant abuses took place at the NSHCC. In 1948, a social worker documented concerns about inadequate food for the children living in the NSHCC. Sexual abuse was documented in the 1980s, including the rape of a child, but no charges were ever laid.231 In 2001, a number of former residents of the home filed lawsuits for abuse,232 some of which dates back to as early as the 1940s.233 In 2014, the premier of Nova Scotia apologized for the abuse as part of a settlement with survivors, and a restorative inquiry was announced in 2015.234 Terrible things happened at this institution that should never happen to anyone. It is entirely possible abuse was present there from its early days. Yet, even then, we can hold this injustice in tension with an acknowledgment of the importance of what the Nova Scotian Black community did by building the home. Building a racially segregated institution, which seems to have been characterized by the same abuses of power as were found at other institutional sites, can be conceptualized as yet another instance of navigating the norms that were available at the time. Black Nova Scotians built for their community\u2019s children a resource often considered at that time indispensable for serving children in need. As in so many other institutions, many children were seriously harmed within its walls. There is frequently a tendency to view historical developments as either good or bad, but removing the NSHCC from \u201cgood\u201d anti-racist history and placing it into \u201cbad\u201d institutional history prevents us from struggling to cultivate a complex relationship with this fundamentally interlocking history and its legacies. Black communities navigated available norms, but didn\u2019t adopt all available norms. As a glaring example with tremendous relevance to contemporary social work, we found no historical record of any Black community in the United States or Canada establishing a child protection agency in which people from outside a family or community scrutinized parents and determined whether a child would be allowed to remain with them. In the extensive social welfare systems created by Black folks in Canada and the United States, we found no evidence of a single Black agency that practised involuntary child apprehension. White child protection agencies didn\u2019t normally* serve Black families until the end of legal racial segregation in the mid-twentieth century. Yet, even in cities with significant Black social welfare infrastructures, including women\u2019s clubs, settlement houses, and orphanages, it seems that no Black community practised child apprehension. (If we\u2019re wrong and one or two communities did so, it would have been extremely marginal considering that we\u2019ve encountered no trace of it.) Black and white social workers learned from one another and often worked together, developing similar (usually racially segregated) services, but Black social workers didn\u2019t practice child apprehension. In the only article we found exploring the fact that professional child welfare didn\u2019t operate in US Black communities until after legal racial segregation was abolished,\u2020 Jillian Jimenez writes: \u201cA shadow child welfare system [existed] that performed similar functions to the public child welfare system from which African American children were largely excluded.\u201d235 In apparently every Black community, people were left to do the work of \u201cchild protection\u201d and \u201cchild welfare\u201d using means that had been available to them before anybody had ever become a paid \u201csocial worker.\u201d In a recent interview about having won the Woman of Distinction Award, Black Canadian politician Zanana Akande was asked where her ethic of \u201ccontinuing to push\u201d for justice originated. In her answer, she described the informal \u201csocial workers who weren\u2019t social workers\u201d who collectively raised her when she was growing up in downtown Toronto in the 1940s and \u201950s: \u201cThat [ethic] comes from where I was born and the people around me \u2013 the first social workers who weren\u2019t social workers, because we were all raised collectively by our parents and by anyone else who happened to walk down the street and see us \u2013 that you must speak out, you must take care of each other, and you must push for what you want.\u201d236 In Black communities prior to the end of racial segregation and the introduction of child protective agencies into Black communities, practices, norms, and mores were in place to protect children from violence, respond to tragedies such as parental death, and so on. \u201cChildren routinely lived with grandparents not only in the case of death, but when one or both parents left the local area to look for work \u2026 [and] children with no family would be taken in by unrelated adults in the neighbourhood who did not have children.\u201d237 Resonant practices have existed in all communities at all times, varying significantly from place to place. Jimenez traces these specific Black child welfare practices to West African traditions of extended kinship and communal care for children, as well as to strategies later developed in response to the violences of slavery \u2013 in which Black children and adults were kidnapped, forcibly separated from one another, and held as white people\u2019s property. In the first half of the twentieth century in Black communities in the United States, the principal strategy for protecting children from abuse and neglect was community surveillance: \u201cthe extended family, especially grandmothers \u2026 aunts, great aunts, and older sisters \u2026 provided a concentric circle of approval and disapproval to support or criticize the child rearing practices of a child\u2019s primary caretakers.\u201d238 There were community-sanctioned interventions for when adults harmed children, which were rooted in community-specific hierarchies of moral and political authority. Older women relatives in Black America occupied the role only then being taken over in white America by paid ruling class strangers. One practice is a violent imposition, and the other assumes communities are capable of healing and protecting themselves; both are specific and situated means of social working to keep children safe from abuse and neglect. A very different child protection system would be in place today if families and communities were imagined capable of protecting and caring for their own children, rather than assuming the state and its professionals must do so. As a consequence of racist laws and mores, Black families were fortunate to rarely have their children apprehended by state authorities during the first half of the twentieth century. Instead, they carried on and internally adapted long-standing traditions of child protection and care. The earliest white child protection agencies were born at a time of normalized extreme anti-Black violence. Black childrearing practices at the time therefore explicitly sought to prevent children from exposing themselves to the normative violences of white supremacy;239 we can imagine the devastation that might have resulted had Black families become targeted by white social work. Black families worked to protect Black children from abusive parents and also from white supremacy. Their efforts were central to Black child protection during a time of widespread lynching and other explicit anti-Black violence. Such child protection isn\u2019t normatively validated as \u201csocial work.\u201d Of all the diverse and significant Black interventions into the social world for over a century, from slavery liberation societies through to the civil rights movement of the mid-twentieth century, there seems to have been a consensus that the approach to \u201cchild protection\u201d taken for granted among white ruling classes wasn\u2019t morally or politically acceptable. No matter how one is positioned in relation to these histories, this wholesale rejection is an astounding fact for us all to seriously reflect upon today. Class Stratification and How It Interlocked with Racism and Social Work As with white social workers, Black social workers in the United States and Canada tended to be upper or middle class people assisting poor people. Class divisions among Black people, however, had different effects and significance from those among white people, given that segregation and racism had a levelling effect on Black communities. No matter how much money you had, you often could not live in a ruling class neighbourhood if you were Black, nor was it easy to get a loan, be free from the threat of racist violence, go many places, or do many other things available to white people. Class status did not inoculate against racism. Carlton-LaNey writes, \u201cThere was very little physical, social and economic distance\u201d between those doing early Black social work and others in the communities where they worked. They \u201clived in the same communities and by virtue of race shared many of the same societal problems and issues of concern.\u201d However, those \u201cwho engaged in the emerging social work profession were among the \u2026 educated elite of the African American community.\u201d240 Educated Black women primarily provided social services,241 which could have perpetuated white ruling class social mores. Yet, Carlton-LaNey asserts that \u201clower class women were also active in clubs and formed organizations in an effort to serve themselves and the needy in their communities.\u201d242 She writes that this class diversity among workers, as well as shared experiences of racism, helped these social workers more reflexively consider their own power: even educated Black social workers with \u201cproperty ownership, poise, and eloquence \u2026 [were often] treated like \u2018washerwomen\u2019 [which] \u2026 kept them attuned to the deplorable conditions to which their less-fortunate sisters were subjected.\u201d243 Through to the 1920s, \u201ca white woman in Halifax looking for help with her laundry felt free to stop any African-Nova Scotian woman on the street and request \u2018where she could get a good girl.\u2019\u201d244 White supremacy served to homogenize Blackness so that, in practice, it was the only relevant identifier in many cases, or at least it was the identity category that trumped all others. The assumption that any Black person would know where to get a cleaner in Halifax was based on the pervasive white supremacist association of Black people with domestic service and dirt. This thinking had important social significance and was intimately tied up with interlocking moral economies of human value. At this time, eugenics was often referred to as \u201cmental hygiene,\u201d245 and Ivory Soap boasted about its ability to \u201ccivilize\u201d Indigenous people.246 This period was also the era in which white ruling class women acquired an unprecedented degree of exalted bourgeois subjectivity. Fellows and Razack explain that dirt was important in constituting these select women as separate and distinct from \u2013 and to imagine themselves morally superior to \u2013 \u201cwasherwomen.\u201d247 The renegotiation of white ruling class women\u2019s positioning within largely unchanged moral economies of human value relied on the intensive and ongoing discursive denigration of others. Remaining racially devalued even with upward class mobility, Black social workers\u2019 experiences of continued discrimination, alongside the relative class diversity among Black service providers, seems to have mitigated the classism normally inherent to social work. Most Black women welfare reformers, according to Gordon, \u201cwere usually newly middle-class, perhaps a generation away from slavery and without much cushion against economic misfortune.\u201d248 These women were living a very different experience of being middle class than that of their white contemporaries.",

Thomas King cites a different representation of rivers,14 implying a distinct  personal-is-political ethics, which is also a different way of imagining that our  lives are shaped within the parameters of legacies of oppression. King says that  Pueblo people understand \u201cevil and good \u2026 not so much [as] distinct and  opposing entities [but] as \u2026 tributaries of the same river.\u201d This world view, he  says, enables \u201cthe tantalizing question of what else one might do if confronted  with the appearance of evil.\u201d15 Maybe care and disinterest, responsibility and  irresponsibility, and work towards justice and participation in injustice are all  tributaries on the same river, rather than opposing one another like riverbanks.  Could this imaginary open up other possibilities when we encounter \u201cevil\u201d \u2013  whether in ourselves or others? Maybe distancing ourselves from violence  perpetration, oppression, and complicity isn\u2019t our only option. Distancing our selves and casting ourselves as innocent makes it less likely we will reflect upon  harm we cause, and upon oppression in which we participate or from which  we benefit. What would it mean for our ethical and political journeys \u2013 for our  \nlives \u2013 if we truly believed there was no \u201cother side\u201d at which to arrive? Gayatri Spivak also uses a water metaphor to illustrate a critical intervention  into norms relating to responsibility and complicity: \u201cThe mainstream has never  run clean, perhaps never can. Part of mainstream education involves learning to  ignore this absolutely, with a sanctioned ignorance.\u201d16 For Spivak, one responsi bility of the critic, the activist, or the helper17 is to \u201cprovide a persistent dredg ing operation\u201d of the mainstream. However, she cautions that this activity \u201cis  counterproductive when it becomes a constant and self-righteous shaming of  fully intending subjects.\u201d18 She\u2019s suggesting that people don\u2019t always act with the  straightforward intention to do what they do, to achieve a desired harmful end,  and with full awareness of how they affect others. Spivak takes complicity very  seriously in reflections on her own participation in oppression.19 She proposes  Copyright \u00a9 2019. University of Toronto Press.

We have to interrogate how the river  shapes us even when we insist we\u2019ve emerged on the other side.

Paige explained this in terms of struggling  for money but giving money to people that ask for it on the street because, \u2018We  need to help each other, it\u2019s not just help yourself, you know?\u2019\u201d Another par ticipant, Louie, also described how poverty led to increased interdependency  with friends and family: \u201cI really think people thrive when they\u2019re intercon \nnecting, but in a capitalist society, they\u2019re like everybody is an individual, fend  for yourself \u2026 but it\u2019s actually not \u2026 the way that we\u2019re supposed to be doing  things.\u201d210 Just as Addams documented in her 1902 critique of friendly visit ing,211 there\u2019s a different moral sensibility among poor communities, which is  valuable if we can think outside of ruling class taken-for-granted moral deni grations of poor folks. Louie clearly states that capitalism and individualism  are at odds with interconnectedness and the thriving that comes with it. She  suggests that capitalist society has it wrong. What poor communities need  is more money and better infrastructural support. They don\u2019t need training,  role models, or mingling. Again, the problem isn\u2019t how poor and otherwise  oppressed groups live their lives; the problem is material inequality and struc tural violence, as well as the normative moral differentiations that make these  things appear acceptable. \nRedevelopment projects miss the point of what makes it difficult to live with out enough money.

Furthermore, for all these same reasons, the disruption and  reconstruction of local social arrangements also undermines a community\u2019s  capacity to organize and resist.212",

When the COS campaigned  against outdoor relief, they were in effect campaigning for imprisonment and  institutionalization as responses to poverty. What\u2019s more, by around 1900 \u2013  when people were first called social workers \u2013 many of the relatively new sites  of confinement had largely abandoned their short-lived optimism about edu cation, community reintegration, and other such stated objectives. They were  now growing due to their openly stated efficiency in removing those considered  to be social burdens and restricting them from procreating, as a result of the  dovetailing spread of eugenics, which held that only those deemed \u201cfit\u201d should  reproduce.50 COS campaigns against outdoor relief thus confined people to  institutional sites that nobody pretended were helpful to those they housed. \nPoverty was often described as a literal disease or infestation needing eradi cation.51 Reverend William Baldwin, representing Toronto\u2019s Associated Chari ties (again, another name of the COS), clearly articulated the movement\u2019s drive  to eradicate poor people: \u201cTo keep them in comfortable quarters and allow  them to live in idleness is not the way to get rid of them. Hard work and strict  discipline \u2026 [are] the best means of getting rid of the professional vagrant.\u201d52 A  report summarizing Baldwin\u2019s statement called poor people an \u201carmy of tramps  that infest this Province.\u201d53 The advocated cure was often to restrict all relief.  And, for those who remained unable to more closely align with ruling class  social mores even when all assistance was taken away as an enactment of instru mental violence,\u2020 the COS promoted the implementation of newly emergent  eugenic principles that sought to eradicate poor and otherwise \u201cunfit\u201d people.54 \nSir Francis Galton first articulated eugenic doctrine in 1865 and later coined  the actual word in 1883.55 Eugenics became an incredibly popular ideology in  Copyright \u00a9 2019.

        "context": "2 \nWhite Supremacy and the Erasure of Racialized Social Workers Social Work History as White Social Work History This chapter furthers the question, began in the last chapter, of what and who gets left out of the standard account. Here we focus primarily on \u201cthe color-line,\u201d a phrase made famous by Black activist-scholar W.E.B Du Bois at the same time as the term \u201csocial work\u201d was coined.1 We focus on the work the colour line continues to do since his time in its framing of the Progressive Era. We reflect upon who gets credited for making history and how this choice maps onto moral economies that separate who is and isn\u2019t a valued human with something to offer our social world. In contrast to the histories most circulated, at the time the term \u201csocial work\u201d was coined, community initiatives and innovations in working with disadvantaged groups as well as efforts to transform political structures were taking place all over the world. Many of the people involved in these diverse interventions into the social world were neither Christian nor secular, and many weren\u2019t white. For example, according to Saba Mahmood, Zaynab al-Ghazali \u201cis credited with establishing a women\u2019s organization [in Egypt] called the Society of Muslim Ladies \u2026 which was initially dedicated to providing charitable services to poor women and children\u201d and later expanded to work towards structural change in collaboration with the Muslim Brotherhood.2 The Society of Muslim Ladies was established in the 1930s, and it might be imagined that al-Ghazali\u2019s efforts were made possible due to feminist successes in Europe and white settler colonies like Canada and the United States. However, Mahmood shows that al-Ghazali\u2019s interventions into the social world were \u201ca product of the sociopolitical ethos of her times and the new possibilities that were opening up for women at the turn of the twentieth century [in Egypt itself]. Al-Ghazali reached adulthood when there had already been almost three decades of women\u2019s activism in Egypt.\u201d3 There was also a proliferation of women\u2019s publications around 1900 that \u201cwas accompanied by an efflorescence of women\u2019s charitable associations, which served as the springboard for women\u2019s entry into public and political life.\u201d4 This Egyptian timeline is concurrent to, and squarely resonant with, first wave feminism in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom, as well as the rise of women\u2019s central role in providing charity that accompanied feminist movements in the Global North. In Europe and white settler colonies, histories of feminism and social work tend to be mapped onto stories of progress, which are framed as a movement away from religion and towards secularism (whether or not that fits with historical figures\u2019 understandings). Indeed, as Sherene Razack observes, \u201cthe secular/religious divide . . . functions as a color line, marking the difference between the modern, enlightened West, and people of color, notably Muslims.\u201d5 This blueprint for historical progress doesn\u2019t map well onto developments in Egypt \u2013 and not because secularism was unavailable as an option. \u201cZaynab al-Ghazali\u2019s first exposure to women\u2019s activism came at the age of sixteen when she joined the Egyptian Feminist Union (EFU), an affiliation that she reportedly later terminated because of the EFU\u2019s \u2018secular orientation.\u2019\u201d6 In reading about al-Ghazali\u2019s treatment of gender relations, it may be easy for many white readers to imagine that secular feminism is a better path towards justice. For example, \u201cthe language of \u2018women\u2019s rights\u2019 finds an important \u2026 place in al-Ghazali\u2019s speeches and writings and is often invoked to emphasize that Muslim women and men are equally called upon to serve God,\u201d7 a priority that may seem misaligned to a secular reader. However, Mahmood demonstrates the profound changes that al-Ghazali and Islamic women\u2019s movements have had on gender relations in Egypt. In her conclusion, she challenges readers with the spectre of genocide, which she suggests is implicit in secular framings of non-secular ways of being: she invites her readers to consider \u201cthat analysis as a mode of conversation [across difference], rather than mastery, can yield a vision of coexistence that does not require making other lifeworlds extinct or provisional.\u201d8 Is it possible for secular white readers in the Global North to imagine that Muslim Egyptian navigations of gender relations are just as legitimate and potentially transformative as those that are valued within secular feminism? Furthermore, what would it mean to take seriously Mahmood\u2019s challenge that we tend to approach difference as something we implicitly aim to make \u201cextinct?\u201d Histories like al-Ghazali\u2019s are left out of the standard account of social work, which traces white US settlement houses and Charity Organization Society initiatives back to white people\u2019s initiatives in the United Kingdom.9 This chapter offers a small corrective to this tendency. We do not, however, claim to offer a complete account of the story of racialized peoples\u2019 contributions to what has come to be called social work. There will always be examples left out, and our account is no exception. However, by foregrounding and naming these exclusions, and by making humble correctives to a few such exclusions, we hope to offer a context for thinking further about the kinds of interventions into the social world that are normally left out of social work history. We aim to show that these exclusions are arbitrary, in the sense of being unjustifiable; yet, at the same time, they are logically coherent within the framework of white supremacy and have real effects on people\u2019s lives and possibilities. They are arbitrary because there is no objective reason to privilege white people\u2019s accomplishments and to leave out those of racialized communities; but they are perfectly sensible and coherent within the moral economy of white supremacy. White supremacy shapes both the inclusions and the exclusions of the standard account of social work\u2019s origin. In response to these exclusions, this chapter highlights some innovations, contributions, and legacies that racialized communities have made, focusing on Black communities in the United States and Canada. The standard account of social work is simply a white account of white social work.* It ignores racialized peoples\u2019 contributions to the mishmash of interventions into our social world that has been called social work for over a century, and thus constructs social work as white in both the past and the present. The few historical figures we name, alongside countless Black anti-slavery and anti-lynching advocates, community organizers, settlement workers, and other activists and charity workers, were active in forging the foundation of modern social work. Yet, it\u2019s only recently that early Black social workers like Ida B. Wells, Mary Ann Shadd Cary, Mary Church Terrell, Reverdy Ransom, and Maggie Walker are having their histories told or read in contexts where there aren\u2019t exclusively Black students, and where these historical figures are understood to be the originators of social work (as opposed to only the originators of Black social work) that they really were. If we understand social work to include various forms of relief initiatives, as well as diverse actions aiming towards community and large-scale political and social transformation \u2013 as with the range of work done at Hull-House or by al-Ghazali and the Society of Muslim Ladies \u2013 then the distinction between what does and does not get officially designated as social work becomes increasingly arbitrary and unjustifiable. As Linda Gordon asserts, \u201cWelfare histories [have] been by definition white-centered.\u201d10 She shows that it\u2019s \u201cpossible to make the widespread welfare reform activity of minority women visible only by changing the definition of the topic and its periodization.\u201d11 Likewise, such a move shifts the understanding of the entirety of social work history. Because social workers are assumed to be white, social work within communities of colour \u2013 including that which inspired later white social workers \u2013 gets almost entirely left out. Before recounting the histories themselves, we might reflect: considering the explicit anti-Black racism and violence that was widespread in Canada and the United States at the time of social work\u2019s nominal emergence, what kinds of efforts would have made sense for Black social workers? This chapter highlights a few stories of people who were engaged in certain kinds of social welfare activity that have not been officially acknowledged as such within histories of social welfare. Histories such as these are frequently dismissed as particular to specific populations. When white people worked with other white people, the particularity wasn\u2019t noted \u2013 whiteness as particularity went unremarked. But Black social work, when discussed at all, tends to be told as Black history rather than part of a collective history. White history is told as a shared history, whereas Black, Indigenous, and racialized histories are normally deemed relevant only to their respective communities. But, considering the social and political context, it made sense for Black social workers to focus on interventions relating specifically to Black communities.* The reasons for this focus include racism, a sense of connection to those communities, a feeling of solidarity with the struggles their own neighbours were experiencing, and the recognition that their neighbours were struggling distinctly, and often more intensely, than white people living nearby (due to racial segregation and the uneven distribution of resources that has always accompanied it in practice12). Black social work was no more particular or insular than work being done within white communities. Yet Black social work, and its contributions to the world we live in, continues to be largely unacknowledged by white recorders of history, which of course includes white recorders of social work history. When white social work was first emerging, a strong and diverse tradition of Black social work was also emerging. Jane Addams is championed as the founder of radical social work, and her anti-racism is used as a prime example of how she lived her political commitments. At the same time (and earlier), however, there were massive organizing efforts on the part of Black people who were pivotal in founding radical social work. If we relieve Addams of some of the responsibility for carrying the entire tradition of social justice\u2013oriented social work practice, we can look to other historical figures and social work movements to see that alternative approaches to helping have always existed \u2013 including among professional social workers. Iris Carlton-LaNey points out that when social work was laying down its roots in white America, Black people were developing a \u201cparallel social welfare system.\u201d13 Because of racist segregation policies, many Black people could not access white social welfare programs, and Black service providers were not welcome in the majority of white organizations. In this context, Black communities\u2019 efforts focused on what at the time was referred to as \u201cracial uplift,\u201d and a number of originators of Black social work believed that Black people should deliver services for Black people. Ida B. Wells, for instance, wrote: \u201cThe Afro-American can do for himself what no one else can do for him.\u201d14 Black communities organized benefit programs, schools, adult education initiatives, community centres, healthcare clinics, homeless shelters, settlement houses, seniors\u2019 homes, youth programs, parenting education, daycares, kindergartens, recreation programs, job banks, clothing banks, ice banks, food banks, and bank banks. And yet, white people providing these types of services to white people at this time is what is called the origin of social work. Therefore, we can ask: Who gets to tell history? Who are its imagined and actual audiences? Who gets cast as the protagonists or primary characters in the stories that are told, and how does this choice affect the take-up of these stories among diverse audiences? Who benefits from these histories being told in the ways that they\u2019re told? And what role do these versions of history have in furthering the moral economies that continue to accumulate moral worth for white subjects and denigrate the imagined value of people of colour? Black Churches: Bestowing Charity and Organizing for Change There are limitless forms by which people help one another. However, resonating with Egyptian developments at this time, two of the key sites in which help became organized and formalized in Black communities were churches (especially those associated with the social gospel movement) and women\u2019s clubs (which were either secular or attached to a religious institution). The church therefore played a key role in the development of Black social work. In white social work, \u201csocial work tended to fill spaces left by the reduced role of religion in everyday life,\u201d15 but organized religion played a more central role in Black social work. This situation arose not only because of the role that organized religion played in the development of charity and aid, which also heavily influenced white social work, but also for reasons particular to Black communities. In many Black communities, churches were the only available community spaces. In many places in the United States, it was illegal for Black people to congregate in groups of more than\n\nChapman, Chris; Withers, A.J..

Edi\u00e7\u00e3o do Kindle. five people other than at church, which meant that organizing was criminalized outside of the church. According to Carter G. Woodson, a prominent Black intellectual at the time, churches were \u201cthe only institution in which [Black people could] freely exercise authority\u201d16 and pursue strategies of self-determination and self-governance.* As a result of these factors, churches were important spaces for community organizing, and they ran numerous social and political programs alongside their more traditional role of providing relief to poor people.17 Some Black people, however, were critical of the role of organized religion. W.E.B. Du Bois, for example, disparaged Black churches for not doing enough to help Black communities. In 1912, he wrote in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) publication The Crisis that the church was \u201cstill building churches when people need homes and schools, and persisting in crucifying critics rather than realizing the handwriting on the wall.\u201d18 At the same time, he recognized the importance of churches and their centrality in Black communities.19 In the conclusion to an extensive study he led on the Black church, Du Bois, with Mary Church Tyrell and Kelly Miller, recognized the significance of the church as \u201ca mighty social power,\u201d but also asserted \u201cit needs cleansing; reviving and inspiring.\u201d20 One of the key influences of social work and the helping professions in Canada and the United States was the social gospel movement.21 Social gospel originated as a reaction to the social and economic devastation that industrial capitalism caused and the absence of an appropriate response from conventional Christianity.22 Made up of radical and progressive Protestants, the movement engaged in a variety of social welfare programs. Many social change\u2013oriented churches throughout the United States implemented important social programs.23 The Institutional Church in Chicago, under the leadership of Black Reverend Reverdy C. Ransom, is one example of the social gospel movement in action. Ransom and his congregation built a settlement house that opened in 1900 and was designed to cater to the needs of the Black community.24 Ransom was a radical, encouraging people to think about adopting socialism, which he saw as a solution to racism.25 He also worked to help settle conflicts between white strikers and Black strikebreakers in Chicago.26 Resonantly, Woodson describes how a Congregational church in Massachusetts under the leadership of W.N. DeBerry established \u201ca free employment bureau, a women\u2019s welfare league, a night school of domestic training, a girls\u2019 and a boys\u2019 club emphasizing the handicrafts, music, and athletics.\u201d27 Similar programs existed in progressive Black churches across the United States and Canada.28 The social gospel movement worked in both white and Black communities to deal with the material crises that people experienced. In addition to increasing people\u2019s access to education, childcare, settlement houses, homeless shelters, and other social services,29 the social gospel movement also worked towards large-scale political change.* Carter G. Woodson, known as the \u201cFather of Black History,\u201d30 referred to the work of social gospellers as \u201csocial work\u201d in The History of the Negro Church in 1921. \u201cSeparate Spheres\u201d and Women\u2019s Clubs Following the social disruptions caused in Europe and white settler spaces by capitalist industrialization and urbanization, a new discourse of gendered mores, norms, and values emerged. This new arrangement, referred to as \u201cseparate spheres,\u201d was a system which held that respectable men and women should only occupy roles then considered gender appropriate. The resultant separation between men and women was helpful in creating possibilities for love-based companionships among ruling class women at the time, known as \u201cBoston marriages\u201d (which we discuss in the next chapter).31 It was oppressive in many other ways, however, and it furthered the moral economy of differentiated human value \u2013 valuing the supposedly men\u2019s sphere over the women\u2019s sphere. According to separate spheres discourse and mores, the public domain (politics, paid work, and so on) was to be peopled exclusively by men, and the private domain (household and family) was to be exclusively women\u2019s domain.32 These supposedly \u201ctraditional\u201d ideas have a much more recent history than we tend to think. Previously in Europe, although gender roles were segregated, local community norms and immediate family needs largely governed how, where, and with whom people spent their time. The home had often been the location of economic activity, whether for farming or cottage industries, and men and women, boys and girls would often work alongside one another on many day-to-day tasks. The notion that men should work for pay and women should tend to the home and care for the family was at best inconsistently followed, and there was no sense that it was morally superior to always segregate genders. In response to the moral panic arising due to the increased personal freedom that resulted from capitalist industrialization and urbanization, separate spheres discourse arose to police interactions between men and women. It was essentially a moral discourse. In order to demonstrate oneself as respectable, a person would only ever labour in ways then considered gender appropriate. Alongside shifting the norms and mores within ruling class culture itself, this change enabled yet another way for poor and racialized people, especially women, to be looked down upon as morally inferior: female slaves and poor women of any race could not abstain from the \u201cpublic\u201d or \u201cmen\u2019s sphere\u201d of labouring for others. Poor women worked outside of their homes to survive,33 and, obviously, slaves could not freely choose how to direct their labour. Thus, ruling class women\u2019s respectability and morality increasingly relied upon differentiating themselves from women who cooked, cleaned, and provided care in other people\u2019s homes and were considered inferior for doing so.34 Relatively well-off Black women, before and after emancipation, often demonstrated their respectability and full humanity by adhering to the dominant social mores of separate spheres. Black communities frequently adopted all or part of separate spheres norms and discourse. Of Black Nova Scotians, for example, Suzanne Morton writes: \u201cGender ideology that placed women in the home offered protection and dignity within their own community, even if it could not secure recognition from the white middle class.\u201d35 Harley explains the adherence to separate spheres norms in the context of the post-emancipation US South: \u201cGender-defined work and domestic responsibilities were symbolic of their new status.\u201d He argues that, within a white supremacist and patriarchal society, \u201csex-segregation helped to protect black women, married or single, from charges of immorality such as those made by nineteenth- and twentieth-century writers and reformers.\u201d36 The performance of separate spheres allowed select Black people to establish membership in the new middle class, which Marie Louise Fellows and Sherene Razack describe as gaining \u201ca toehold on respectability.\u201d37 Although white supremacy and patriarchy continued to shape and define their lives and possibilities, some Black women were able to accumulate the social markers of the bourgeois class (certain kinds of dress and education, avoiding labour considered unbecoming for a lady, and so on) through which they precariously entered the ranks of the middle class. As in white communities, separate spheres mores intersected with the rise of the middle class professions, which shaped selective opportunities for women to enter the public sphere \u2013 but only in roles related to the direction and surveillance of the private sphere. Women occupied paid positions in nursing, childhood education, and social welfare activities, but only rarely in more squarely male-gendered professions such as law or medicine. In Black communities, the transition to women occupying leadership roles within the female-gendered spheres seems to have been smoother than in white communities. For instance, Shirley Yee writes: \u201cBlack women often worked with Black men in building institutions that were critical to daily life. Black women\u2019s involvement in the establishment of churches, schools, and mutual aid societies reflected a long legacy of cooperation between Black men and women.\u201d She shows how \u201cBlack Canadian women continually blurred the line between public and private and tailored their own notions of \u2018true\u2019 womanhood to the realities they faced in daily life.\u201d38 In both Canada and the United States, according to Yee, \u201cthe adoption of patriarchal structures that ironically symbolized freedom also illustrated the pervasiveness of sex role ideology.\u201d However, this ideology was resisted too \u2013 or at least it was navigated in ways that seem to have been unique to Black communities: \u201cThrough their public activism, Black women maintained the interconnectedness of family and community, the private and the public \u2013 between which there was little distinction\u201d in their real lives.39 Their ability to interconnect may have been because Black women had always worked in the \u201cpublic sphere,\u201d and these social mores were only newly available to them; and it may have also reflected distinct (and surely internally diverse) gender mores and norms that had been brought over from West Africa and were preserved through slavery.40 During this time, women\u2019s clubs were one public forum for women to engage in the social governance of the private realm, discussing and acting on issues that were deemed gender-role appropriate. The 1890s saw a wave of clubs emerge in the United States that were focused not only on the home, but also on social and political reform.41 In this decade alone, clubs emerged in New York, Boston, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Jefferson City, Omaha, New Orleans, Knoxville, and Providence \u2013 and likely in smaller communities as well.42 In 1896, the National Association of Colored Women was founded by activists including Ida B. Wells-Barnett, Mary Church Terrell, Francis Harper, and Harriet Tubman, bringing Black women\u2019s clubs from across the country into a coalition.43 Women\u2019s clubs of this era were largely focused on individual and community betterment, which they called racial uplift.44 Clubs also served as a training ground for women to obtain community work and social service skills.45 With some important exceptions, these clubs were run by middle and upper class Black women, who could follow separate spheres mores for women46 and often had a college education.47 Women\u2019s clubs typically espoused domestic feminism, which, according to Nancy Cott, is \u201cwomen\u2019s assertion of private power (particularly reproductive control) within their families.\u201d48 Club women, according to Anne Meis Knupfer, \u201cperceived their roles of mother, wife, and homemaker as cornerstones to \u2018race uplift\u2019 and progress.\u201d49 They founded orphanages, settlement houses, youth clubs, kindergartens, women\u2019s education opportunities, employment services, youth/recreational programs, nursing homes, daycares, and at least one YWCA.50 Notably, these programs were all in keeping with the ideologies of domestic feminism and separate spheres. Club women helped establish many important social services and worked towards strengthening the Black community, always in keeping with those arenas of life in which it was normatively deemed appropriate for women to participate. The social and political effects of the work of Black women\u2019s clubs, like the concrete effects of Addams\u2019s and Richmond\u2019s work, were therefore complicated. They provided crucial programs and resources to communities that were usually excluded from white social work services, but they also acted to police morality and gender roles. Women\u2019s clubs worked towards reform and progress, but they also confined social service providers and recipients alike to gender roles deemed appropriate according to classed and racialized social mores.* The Great Migration: Migrant Assistance and the Shift towards Black Incarceration The \u201cGreat Migration\u201d began around 1915 and, according to Isabel Wilkerson, was \u201ca statistically measurable demographic phenomenon marked by unabated outflows of black \u00e9migr\u00e9s\u201d to Northern US states.51 In order to support the many people who were arriving in cities in the North, often incredibly poor and in need of assistance, Black people set up a number of welfare programs.52 One of the key areas of assistance was with women from the South, many of whom were targeted by predatory employment agencies that would force them into debt and, at times, horrendous working conditions. Black (and sometimes white) social workers were sent out to assist with directions, funds, a place to stay, and advocacy.53 The largest organization working with Black migrants from the South in this period was the National Urban League (NUL).54 Black social worker and social work educator George Haynes founded and led the NUL, which Elmer Martin and Joanne Mitchell Martin say had the \u201cleading, most advanced black social workers.\u201d55 The NUL monitored existing relief programs, advocating for Black people who had been treated unjustly.56 They worked to ensure economic access to Black people, which involved combatting racism and difficult social and material conditions,\n\nChapman, Chris; Withers, A.J..

Edi\u00e7\u00e3o do Kindle. conditions, and to reframe Southern Black migrants as skilled workers in the ruling class social imagination. The NUL advocated for Black migrants to become \u201cskilled, unionized industrial workers [who would be fully integrated] into the urban political economy.\u201d57 Yet, this goal was accomplished by working to assimilate the migrants to Northern and middle class mores and sensibilities. This approach, according to Martin and Martin, led to social workers focusing on changing individuals to adapt to existing social structures rather than working to change unjust social systems58 \u2013 as with most social services at the time. The demographic and social shift of the Great Migration also marked an important point in previously all-white \u201cservices\u201d that were now available to, and imposed upon, Black people. Sharon Snyder and David Mitchell discuss the profound differences in the institutionalization of communities based on race. Once slavery was abolished, the US state began the mass incarceration of Black people; by the start of the Great Migration, Black people made up the majority of people incarcerated in prisons and asylums. Due to racist segregation, Black people hadn\u2019t previously been institutionalized in poor houses and asylums during much of the nineteenth century, but this policy shifted post-emancipation, and Black people became increasingly pathologized. By 1919, for example, the political phenomena of diagnosing \u201cfeeblemindedness was so prevalent among African American children that all the black schools in one southern Georgia county had been closed.\u201d59 Now, articulated through the new eugenics discourse, all Black children were said to be uneducable. Snyder and Mitchell describe how the white supremacist pathologization of the entire population of Black people as feebleminded \u201cserved to disqualify the population as viable candidates for eugenically based [individualistic] interventions.\u201d They write that Black people therefore \u201clargely escaped the devastation of eugenics-based practices,\u201d and, as a result, it was only in \u201cthe late 1940s [that] African Americans with disabilities begin to be institutionalized along with their white counterparts.\u201d60 While this pattern seems true of medically justified institutionalization, they also observe that the mass imprisonment of Black people had begun earlier. At this time, any gender-segregated confinement was commonly rationalized as a form of eugenics with the explicitly intended effect of keeping people from reproducing. These early justifications should be kept in mind when reflecting upon the political function of prisons and other closed institutions today. From the beginning of the Great Migration, Black communities organized to provide \u201coutdoor relief,\u201d which allowed people to access goods and resources while remaining free from confinement; at the same time, white communities were beginning to massively confine many Black people in the asylums and prisons that were a legacy of an earlier move towards the \u201cindoor relief\u201d of poor white people. As was the case with the earlier shift among denigrated Europeans and white settlers,* the massive use of confinement came about because it became increasingly socially unacceptable for white people to openly and publicly kill and torture Black people,61 due to the efforts of early Black social working and activism. This new use of confinement as a primary means of the racist social control of Black people also coincided closely with the mass confinement of Indigenous children in the Indian residential school system, which the government of the Province of Canada took on as a major policy initiative in the 1840s;62 it was now also becoming increasingly socially unacceptable for white people to openly and publicly kill and torture Indigenous people.63 So, while it is true that Black, Indigenous, and racialized people largely escaped the specific violences of early eugenic policies and practices,64 this \u201cescape\u201d carries a very different meaning if intersected with concurrent histories of anti-Black lynching, western expansion, and the Indian Wars. Once such overt racialized violence became increasingly less acceptable, imprisonment, institutionalization, and Indian residential schools were massively used against racialized and Indigenous populations.65 Continuities can therefore be traced between plantation slavery and today\u2019s seemingly entirely distinct institutions of anti-Black racism. For example, Malcolm X recalled his childhood involvement with state welfare workers as so fundamentally characterized by white people shaming his mother that he considered it a legacy of rampant white shaming, denigration, and control of Black mothers during slavery; he also notes another continuity of slavery in the fact that he became the legal property of the white state once apprehended, with white social workers controlling where he lived and what he did.66 Anti-racist activists have also drawn connections between slavery and what was only then becoming today\u2019s prison system. Although US slavery was abolished in 1865 through the Thirteenth Amendment, the same legislative act named the enslavement of convicts an exception: \u201cNeither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\u201d67 This law enabled two already existing systems of violence and control to intersect and maintain the exploitation of Black labour. Laws in the North and South that targeted free Black people already existed, enabling Black people to be arrested and punished for things that no white person was criminalized for doing. Following slavery abolition, this persecution intensified with the Black Codes of 1865 and 1866.68 These codes intersected with another violent system that previously mostly targeted white convicts and hadn\u2019t yet been an instrument of anti-Black racism. The convict lease system allowed convicts to be \u201cleased\u201d to companies and forced to engage in unpaid labour (the state was paid a small sum for their labour but prisoners received nothing). Post-emancipation, in tandem with the Black Codes and the continued legality of enslaving convicts according to the Thirteenth Amendment, the convict lease system enabled the enslavement of many Black people. In 1892, Ida B. Wells documented conditions within this racist system: \u201cIn one camp it is stated that the mortality is 10 per cent per month, and in another even more than that. In these camps men and women are found chained together.\u201d She also reported: \u201cMen who failed to perform their task of mining from two to four tons of coal per day were fastened to planks by the feet, then bent over a barrel and fastened by the hands on the other side, stripped and beaten with a strap.\u201d69 Although fewer people were subjected to this system than had been subjected to slavery, the experiences of those subjected to convict leasing weren\u2019t particularly different from slavery. A similar pattern of reform functioning simply to reorganize power followed the civil rights gains and abolition of legal racial segregation a century later. One racist system was abolished, and other long-existing systems of control and violence (previously used mostly against marginalized white people) now became mobilized in anti-Black racism: \u201cchild protective systems\u201d didn\u2019t normatively target Black families until the end of racial segregation,70 psychiatry began to target folks active in Black Power movements, so that \u201cschizophrenia became a Black disease;\u201d71 and the US prison system has expanded monumentally since the gains of Black Power movements. There\u2019s a clear relationship between the inheritances of slavery and the ongoing white supremacist structural violence of the prison system. Due to the specific context of the historical emergence of the prison and the shared characteristics of certain power relations in slavery and imprisonment, Angela Davis invites her readers to consider: \u201cIs racism so deeply entrenched in the institution of the prison that it is not possible to eliminate one without eliminating the other?\u201d72 In addition to continuities dating back to slavery in today\u2019s anti-Black racism, new racist stories emerged in the wake of slavery abolition that serve to pre-empt and delegitimize critique of the white supremacist prison system. Post-emancipation, Black people were subjected to the tremendously harsh and arbitrary Black Codes and thus were incarcerated as a result of structural anti-Black racism rather than due to committing a disproportionate number of crimes. However, critique was pre-empted within white consciousness when \u201cduring the 1870s the growing number of black prisoners in the South further buttressed the belief that African Americans were inherently criminal.\u201d73 This belief dovetailed with concurrent developments in eugenic criminology that claimed to scientifically prove that some people were \u201cborn criminals.\u201d74 While eugenic criminology tended to target marginalized white people (due perhaps to the continuous violence of anti-Black lynching and the eugenic belief that every single Black person is unfit75), the notion of an inherent criminality intersected with new discourses of anti-Black racism at the time of slavery abolition. As a result, we\u2019ve inherited and continue to perpetuate the enduring, false, and clearly racist notion that Black people are more prone to crime than white people. Black Settlement Houses Settlement houses were also founded in Black communities during the Progressive Era. The standard account of the development of social work depicts settlement houses as following a model imported from the United Kingdom, but Ralph Luker argues that these institutions were strongly influenced by missions established by Northern Black churches in the South starting in 1869, six years after slavery was abolished in the United States. These missions shared similar ideas and practices, and sometimes staff. Luker calls these Black missions \u201cproto-settlement houses.\u201d Many were developed by Black religious organizations, others by white religious or philanthropic organizations.76 These \u201cproto-settlement houses\u201d were created to address the difficulties many Black people in the South faced post-emancipation, and they preceded the first settlement house in the world (Toynbee Hall, in London, England) by fifteen years. In 1890, the year after Jane Addams and Ellen Gates Starr founded Hull-House, Janie Barrett founded the Locust Street Settlement in Virginia, which is officially the first \u201csettlement house\u201d for Black people.77 The timeline, however, may prove a little more complicated. The Locust Street Settlement grew out of a service Barrett had been providing in her own home for several years previous to this point.78 But Hull-House didn\u2019t emerge the previous year with the breadth of services it would later come to offer; it started much more humbly, initially only providing childcare for working women.79 What this complication means is that Barrett had initiated some of the work, later called the settlement work of the Locust Street Settlement, several years before Addams had even devised the idea of opening a \u201csettlement house\u201d of her own. Does that timeline mean Barrett should get credit for the first US settlement house? Maybe, maybe not.* But it certainly makes a difference to how this history tends to be framed. As discussed in the previous chapter, origin stories matter. They make a difference to how social work is conceived, how race is conceived, and how the two are imagined to intersect with one another. If Hull-House was only the first American \u201csettlement house\u201d in name, or even only \u201cthe first white settlement house,\u201d as opposed to being the first settlement house in terms of what it did, then surely this alternative timeline complicates the account that tends to be told about the birth of social work. If concrete and acknowledged antecedents to settlement work are found in earlier Black social interventions, this finding complicates accounts we tend to tell about a number of things, from social work to the role of Black people in shaping the world more generally. At least eleven Black communities had settlement houses by 1910, and several had more than one (Philadelphia had at least three). Black missions or settlements (the name is significant: \u201cmissions\u201d underscores that these predated Hull-House and even Toynbee Hall; \u201csettlements\u201d mobilizes the moral economies of white supremacy and secularism to bestow a certain legitimacy to this Black \u201csocial work\u201d) provided a plethora of services and programs, including schools for students and future teachers, healthcare services, agricultural conferences, mothers\u2019 meetings, short-term housing, daycare, and the distribution of coal and food. Some also conducted social science studies of the Black communities they served.80 Woman\u2019s Christian Temperance Union Another important part of social work history that often gets left out of the standard account is temperance organizing. In the mid- to late nineteenth century, the temperance movement was large and very influential. The largest temperance organization was the Woman\u2019s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), founded in 1874. The WCTU had a massive woman-run publishing operation \u2013 producing 125,000 pages in 1890. In Canada, the first WCTU chapter was founded in Ontario in 1877; the Dominion WCTU, Canada\u2019s national organization, was founded in 1888. The Canadian WCTUs were modelled after and mentored by the American WCTU and had their strongest support in rural areas.",

The WCTU in the United States was made up of autonomous local organizations, some of which were mixed race while others were racially segregated. In the South, it was commonplace to have segregated unions; generally, Black unions were called \u201cnumber two.\u201d81 Therefore, both of the following are true: white supremacy ensured that Black women were considered second class in the national unions and broader social structures;82 and Black women were active in WCTUs and made important contributions to the organization and the temperance movement more broadly.83 It is important to acknowledge the exaltation of white women in the leadership of the organization, as well as to recognize that Black women played significant roles in it. The most prominent Black woman in the WCTU was Francis Harper. She became the superintendent of Work Among the Colored People of the North in 1883, a position she held for several years. Alison Parker explains that Harper and other Black women were attracted to the WCTU because of \u201cits commitment to national legislation and federal solutions to moral and social problems in the United States.\u201d84 Harper strove towards interracial cooperation and travelled the country advocating for it within the WCTU and Black temperance activism more generally. Harper supported women\u2019s suffrage and viewed white women as important potential allies. She advocated for and had some (limited) success in having more Black representation in the national governing bodies of the WCTU.85 The WCTU and other temperance organizations did a great deal of the kinds of work that those who are credited as founding social work were also doing. Like Hull-House, the WCTU was headquartered in Chicago and did social work such as operating homes for \u201cfallen women,\u201d establishing kindergartens, providing vocational training, advocating for better care for orphaned children, engaging in prison and policing reform projects (which included calls for police matrons and forced prison labour), providing educational programs for mothers and children, and advocating for legislation reform to protect girls.86 The WCTU also worked to lay the groundwork for women to become more prominent in political reform. Significantly, Francis Willard, the long-time leader of the WCTU, called the work of the WCTU \u201csocial work.\u201d* Why then would the WCTU be left out of the standard account of social work history? Carol Mattingly posits that the WCTU is largely excluded from feminist history because of \u201ccontemporary scholars\u2019 discomfort with temperance women\u2019s religious/evangelical associations.\u201d87 This theory seems likely in relation to social work history, whether feminist or otherwise, due to the normative notion that progress over the last few centuries has mapped onto increasing secularism. From a contemporary standpoint, temperance organizing is a political anomaly: these women often used direct action protest tactics and were religious zealots. They viewed all social issues as caused by a single thing \u2013 alcohol (and sometimes other drugs like tobacco) \u2013 and they believed that eliminating this vice would solve social problems such as poverty and violence against women. Indeed, Frances Willard quoted Richard Cobden: \u201cTemperance Reform lies at the foundation of all reforms.\u201d88 Perhaps seemingly paradoxical by contemporary standards, Sharon Cook argues that the WCTU\u2019s \u201cconservative ideas of family relationships could, and did, result in progressive demands.\u201d89 As a prime example, the WCTU led what may have been the earliest mass campaign against men\u2019s violence against women and children \u2013 still a central social work issue today. The WCTU rallied around the watchword \u201chome protection,\u201d coined by Canadian WCTU leader Letitia Youmans. Willard made this watchword a guiding principle for the organization.90 Towards the end of the nineteenth century, alcohol consumption had been constructed as masculine with, according to Cook, \u201cits most destructive impact on the home and the often defenceless family.\u201d91 Alcohol was blamed for men\u2019s desertion of their wives and children, poverty, domestic violence, and sexual assault. The WCTU saw eliminating alcohol as removing the root cause of all these problems. The WCTU circulated petitions against the assault on women and girls, and the organization\u2019s members attended criminal trials in support of female victims of sexual violence. They led campaigns to raise the age of consent in the United States and Canada, and were almost always successful.92 Cook therefore writes that temperance was \u201ca \u2018constellation\u2019 issue,\u201d which included \u201cseveral associated \u2013 and ultimately more important \u2013 concerns, through which women expressed their outrage at male violence and irresponsibility, their fears for the survival of the family unit, and, eventually, their collective demands for legislative solutions to these problems.\u201d93 While blaming alcohol and other intoxicants for men\u2019s violence against women, the WCTU nevertheless also politicized violence against women as a gendered social issue and was seemingly the first large cohesive group that organized to eliminate it. As with many social workers then and now, child protection and well-being were a major WCTU concern. In addition to homes for single mothers and their children, the WCTU worked with children\u2019s aid societies to identify and assist children in need. When a child protection agency was created in Ontario, the WCTU expressed the desire to \u201cgreatly assist by recommending the names of suitable persons to help in this work.\u201d94 In the United States, the Department of Securing Homes for Homeless Children attempted to do just that. Willard wrote: \u201cCooperation with existing Children\u2019s Aid Societies is recommended \u2026 and [they] are glad to welcome us as coadjutors. It is not too much to say that the salvation of our beloved country depends upon the salvation of these children.\u201d95 The WCTU and its youth counterpart, the YWCTU, ran a number of homes for women in the United States. In Canada, Ottawa\u2019s Home for Friendless Women provided shelter for \u201cfallen women\u201d with children, teaching them parenting skills and providing them with basic necessities. In order to stay in the home, women had to agree to live there for one year or more. The program was designed to both punish and rehabilitate these women, in part through long hours of laundry work. The shelter also took in old women. Another shelter was the \u201cFrances E. Willard Home for Girls [which] was a temporary shelter for young women in Toronto founded around 1895.\u201d96 Its 1905 annual report stated: \u201cGirls coming to the city with no definite idea as to employment are counselled to go to private houses as domestics, and situations are usually found for them.\u201d97 In 1903, the Ontario WCTU noted: \u201cOwing to the ever-increasing demand for domestics the average time of the girls in Home is too short to admit of much training, nevertheless we are persuaded that through the sheltering care of the Home and its matron many a soul has been saved from degradation.\u201d98 The Ontario WCTU\u2019s annual reports from 1890 to 1926 also suggest an ongoing interest in working specifically in Black and Indigenous communities.99 While they seem to have imagined that work in Indigenous communities first required contact with white missionaries,* it appears that the position of superintendent for \u201cWork among the Colored People\u201d was inconsistently held by Black and white women.* These reports also suggest a different spin on \u201ctemperance,\u201d which makes sense given the era, but is often left out of what could perhaps be called the standard account of the WCTU. It would seem that their concern about alcohol was, at least in part, a eugenic one. As mentioned earlier, eugenicists believed that social and behavioural influences could shape biology as much as they believed that degeneracy works in the opposite direction. Drinking could thus both cause bad heredity and be caused by bad heredity. Therefore, drinking was believed to lead to many other forms of moral and physical degeneracy. Mrs E. Adelia Lucas served as superintendent of the Ontario WCTU\u2019s Department of Heredity and Hygiene. In 1890, she wrote: \u201cThe sin of bringing into the world diseased and defective children is almost unpardonable, and the sin of marrying and inebriating and having descendants tainted and switched off on to the side-track of ruin is literally a crime that can never be atoned for.\u201d100 The WCTU founded the Department of Heredity and Hygiene to investigate the eugenic causes of alcohol and tobacco consumption, which \u201cwas soon broadened, so as to include all hereditary tendencies, healthful and pure, as well as diseased conditions.\u201d Lucas maintained that these tendencies reflect \u201cone of God\u2019s primal laws for all living things.\u201d101 Her eugenic rhetoric, then, is thoroughly Christian \u2013 undermining the often-assumed analysis that what was considered science displaced religion at this \u201cprogressive\u201d time. The WCTU\u2019s Department of Heredity and Hygiene wove science into its religious world view. Anti-Lynching Lynching, the act of extralegal mob murder, became increasingly commonplace as a racialized form of violence in many parts of the United States following emancipation. Although lynching was not a new practice, for the first time in 1885 there were more lynchings of Black people than white, and this tendency persisted until around the time that Black people began to be institutionalized.102 The year-by-year statistics show a dramatic increase of lynching in general, alongside a decrease in white people who were lynched each year. When Black people were no longer considered the property of individual white people who could punish and kill them at will, mobs of white people began to increasingly murder Black people. This violence was often rationalized by claiming that they were protecting themselves or other whites (particularly the virtue of white women) from crimes committed by Black people. According to Davis, after the Civil War, \u201cwhite supremacy continued to be embraced by vast numbers of people and became deeply inscribed in new institutions. One of these post-slavery institutions was lynching, which was widely accepted for many decades thereafter.\u201d103 Lynching was brutal and torturous; it was also commonplace. A draft of a petition to the federal and state governments in 1918 describes what was going on at the time: The reported causes for such appalling brutality run the gamut from alleged violation of the honor of white women to disputing the word of white men \u2026 [However,] only about five per cent of these murders are reputed to have been inflicted upon accused violators of womanhood \u2026 [so] the desire to protect womanhood is almost negligibly among the so-called causes of lynchings \u2026 May your silence be construed as tacit approval or active tolerance of these things?104 Ida B. Wells-Barnett estimated that 10,000 Black people were lynched in the three decades following the Civil War (1865\u20131895).105 These murders were horrors on multiple levels: they targeted individuals for torture and death, affected families who were left grieving their loved ones and finding themselves in deeper poverty with the loss of their husband or father\u2019s income, and also affected entire communities, in that many Black people knew people who had been lynched or disappeared. That one could be attacked for standing up for oneself, defending oneself, or simply for being Black would have led to persistent fear in the Black community, as it was designed to do. Trigger warning: Please be advised that the following four paragraphs include graphic descriptions of lynchings. Lynchings were often conducted during the day and in public in order to maximize their impact on terrorizing Black populations and constraining them to rigidly racialized social mores. The 1918 anti-lynching petition mentioned earlier, for example, describes one lynching in which a Black man was burned at the stake and \u201can entire helpless colored population was marched around the fire, amid fumes of a burning human being and put on notice that as that black man was suffering they too should fear to suffer.\u201d106 Lynching was explicitly about keeping Black people in fear as a tactic to keep them subordinated. It secured the force of the colour line post-emancipation, socializing both white and Black people to occupy their respective stratified moral and political positions. At the height of anti-Black lynching, white people took photos of mutilated Black bodies and had them mass printed as postcards,107 which were sold at stores and sent through the US postal service.* The rise of anti-Black lynching maps neatly onto the birth and flourishing of eugenics. If not taken as mere coincidence, this intersection suggests a shift in ruling class white morality in Europe and white settler colonies where racialized, poor, disabled, and otherwise oppressed communities were being targeted for eradication in new ways. As poor and disabled white people were increasingly targeted for incarceration and reproductive,\n\nChapman, Chris; Withers, A.J..

Edi\u00e7\u00e3o do Kindle. economic, and social death, Black people were initially not incarcerated; instead they were being killed. Of the uneven relationship at the time between anti-Black lynching and disablist eugenics, one illustrative event was the murder of a \u201cseventeen year old boy by the name of Jesse Washington \u2026 in 1916,\u201d which is the year after the cornerstone eugenic criminology text, The Criminal Imbecile, was published.108 James Allen says that Jesse Washington was \u201cseriously mentally challenged. The wife of the farmer he worked for was found dead.\u201d109 Jesse was tried and convicted. From Rafter\u2019s history of eugenic criminology, we might expect that Jesse would have been given an indefinite prison sentence, resulting in a eugenically rationalized lifelong incarceration due to his intellectual disability \u2013 although in Texas, where he was killed, he may have been more likely confined to an asylum for his life. Regardless, neither of these things took place. Instead he was dragged out of the courtroom, kicked down the steps, tortured, burned alive, castrated, had his fingers cut off one by one, and hanged. \u201cThere were 16,000 people crowding the street to watch this boy be tortured \u2026 [T]here were cheers, like at a football game, cheering the torturers on.\u201d Perhaps Jesse was partly targeted because he was disabled, but he was publicly tortured and murdered because he was Black.110 Ida B. Wells-Barnett Black communities fought vigorously to abolish lynching. One of the most prominent anti-lynching activists was Ida B. Wells (Wells-Barnett,\u2020 following her marriage).111 She was also a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the National Association of Colored Women, and was active in the women\u2019s club movement. In 1884, she first gained wide recognition for refusing to move from an all-white train car and for winning a settlement against the railroad.112 Wells wrote a condemnation of lynching in Memphis\u2019s Free Speech and Headlight after her friend Tom Moss was lynched for defending himself from white men\u2019s physical attacks in 1892. Due to the response to this condemnation, she was forced to flee the South. She recalls: \u201cIt was for the assertion of this fact, in the defense of her own race, that the writer hereof became an exile; her property destroyed and her return to her home forbidden under penalty of death.\u201d113 Nevertheless, she continued to agitate against lynching. In 1899, she wrote and circulated a pamphlet, \u201cLynch Law in Georgia,\u201d to Black communities in Chicago. She wrote: \u201cThe real purpose of the savage demonstrations is to teach the Negro that in the south he has no rights that the law will enforce. Samuel House was burned to teach the Negroes that no matter what a white man does to them, they must not resist.\u201d114 In response to dominant framings of anti-Black lynching more generally, and specifically to Jane Addams\u2019s acceptance of this normative white framing in her own condemnation of lynching, Wells demonstrated that most lynchings didn\u2019t involve even a claim* that the murdered man had raped a white woman.115 She showed that many of the lynchings committed on the grounds of sexual assault by Black men against white women were actually white responses to consensual interracial relationships, which were considered unacceptable within interlocking white supremacist patriarchal moral economies.116 White men had only recently lost unmitigated sexual access to the Black women they owned in law, regardless of these women\u2019s desires and consent, with the end of slavery.117 The predominant white account of lynching at the time was that white women were regularly raped by Black men, but Andrea Smith challenges the fictitiousness of this narrative: \u201cIn fact, Black women needed protection from white men.\u201d118 Indeed, Wells-Barnett\u2019s grandmother was a slave and her father a slave-owner\u2019s son \u2013 so he was likely a child who resulted from rape, as was common during slavery.119 Although fictitious, the prevalent notion that white men had to lynch Black men in order to save white women from Black rape was so pervasive that Hollywood\u2019s first blockbuster, The Birth of a Nation, which had the highest grossing ticket sales until Gone with the Wind twenty-four years later,120 depicts what claims to be a historical account of post-Civil War reconstruction and glorifies the founding of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) and a lynching in response to a Black man raping a white woman.121 When considering the views of Smith and Wells-Barnett on lynching Black men accused of raping white women, it\u2019s important to note that white men who raped any woman of any race were never lynched. In fact, most often there was no consequence at all. Contemporary readers should remember this point if they find Wells-Barnett\u2019s handling of rape and sexual assault accusations troubling due to having been socialized within second wave feminism\u2019s crucial politicization of sexual assault and the importance of believing those who say they\u2019ve been sexually assaulted. That indispensable lesson needs to be taken into account, alongside a concern about white supremacist framings of Black and racialized men as particularly prone to rape and other patriarchal violence. Of course, even consensual relationships can involve sexual assault \u2013 a point which could be said to become lost within Wells-Barnett\u2019s claim that the issue pertains to race and not sexual assault as the (interracial) relationship was consensual. (That, said, it was not until the 1970s in the United States122 and in 1983 in Canada123 that men could be held legally responsible for raping their wives.) However, it doesn\u2019t appear Wells-Barnett believed that rape never happened. But she was fighting against the ruse by which rape (real or fictitious) was used to excuse lynching. Like many other Black feminists, Wells-Barnett understood how gender and race interlocked, and she fought against this interlocking oppression rather than against racism or sexism in isolation. Carlton-LaNey writes of such anti-lynching work, saying that Black women at the time \u201crecognize[d] the political nature of sexism long before their white counterparts.\u201d Wells-Barnett and other early Black social workers \u201cfaced the fact that sexual exploitation and violence were perpetuated by both African American and white men.\u201d Carlton-LaNey therefore argues that \u201cpoliticizing sexual exploitation and harassment for African American women placed it squarely within the context of race. Combatting sexual exploitation, therefore, was inextricably linked to race uplift.\u201d124 Early anti-racist feminism did not minimize sexism or sexual assault; rather, it politicized sexism, sexual assault, and responses to them in multiple directions. Andrea Smith begins her chapter \u201cSexual Violence as a Tool of Genocide\u201d by troubling Susan Brownmiller\u2019s second wave white feminist assertion that rape \u201cis nothing more or less than a conscious process of intimidation by which all men keep all women in a state of fear.\u201d Smith uses this statement as a springboard to explore how racism and colonialism shape the particulars of what rape is.125 Likewise, Wells-Barnett was centrally concerned with situating rape and rape discourse within what contemporary feminists call interlocking oppression, as evidenced by her repeated discussions of gender and race and, to a lesser extent, class.126 Such early anti-racist feminist understandings of interlocking oppression trouble the common history of feminism in which interlocking analyses are a recent development initiated by Black feminists such as the Combahee River Collective,127 Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw,128 Patricia Hill Collins,129 Angela Davis,130 Audre Lorde,131 and bell hooks.132 Without minimizing the importance of Black feminism since the 1970s (which often honours earlier Black feminist history), the Black feminist struggle to work against interlocking oppression goes back to the first wave of feminism, which is largely left out of white histories of feminism. It\u2019s not that we wish to reduce the importance of recent anti-racist feminist authors and activists; it\u2019s that remembering the earlier anti-racist feminists raises troubling questions about how feminism\u2019s history up to the 1970s came to be recorded as yet another white history. After fleeing the South, Wells-Barnett organized anti-lynching organizations in a number of states.133 These and other anti-lynching campaigns were hugely influential in Black communities in the United States. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) emerged from anti-lynching activists. Founded in 1909 by a mixture of some of the Black community organizers we\u2019re discussing in this chapter \u2013 Wells-Barnett, Terrell, and Du Bois \u2013 and some white activists (including Addams), the NAACP has worked for racial equality for over a century and is still active today.134 White Social Work and Anti-Lynching Addams and Wells-Barnett were contemporaries and allies in numerous political struggles.135 Although Addams was somewhat exceptional (for a white person) for her commitment to anti-racism, including her activism against lynching, she also accepted that aspects of the white supremacist connection between sexual assault and lynching were true. She was a member of the NAACP at the time, yet she felt entitled to do and say things that appear to have been unaccountable to the experiences of Black communities. According to Wilma Peebles-Wilkins and E. Aracelis Francis, Addams \u201cdid not seem to understand that lynchings involved innocent victims and were not just an unacceptable response to crime.\u201d136 Addams accepted the view that Black men posed a threat to white women and white communities, but objected to lynchings on the grounds that they were not an effective deterrent to this kind of violence and punishment for crimes should be left to the legal system. She also wrote that lynchings were effective in reducing crimes committed by Black men because \u201ccertain elements of the self can be prevented from coming into action,\u201d but pointed out that this inhibition was only a temporary fix because these \u201celements of the self\u201d might resurface.137 Addams\u2019s analysis was shaped by her whiteness and her class positioning, by moral economies of white supremacy, and by discourses stressing the importance of the rule of law and Black men\u2019s criminality. Like Addams, Willard of the WCTU also didn\u2019t understand that lynching was used to control and terrorize Black people. The WCTU refused to allow Wells to address its annual national assembly in 1893. The following year, Wells secured the sponsorship of an organization to ensure that she could address the meeting. She wanted to confront the WCTU\u2019s failure to publicly condemn the lynching of Black men.138 Wells\u2019s insistence on confronting Willard and the WCTU was provoked by an 1890 interview in which Willard made several racist comments about Black people. Willard\u2019s remarks included reiterating the notion that Black men pose a threat to the safety of women and children. She said of white Southerners: \u201cThe problem in their hands is immeasurable. The colored race multiplies like the locusts of Egypt. The grog-shop [liquor store] is a center of power. The safety of women, of childhood, of the home is menaced.\u201d139 Willard thus reiterated the frequent justification of lynching due to the supposed threat that Black men posed to white women. It is particularly concerning that one of the earliest organizations combatting violence against women reified the idea that Black men were exceptionally violent towards women and failed to condemn the racist violence of lynching. When Wells identified Willard\u2019s position as untrue and racist, Willard defended her position. However, she added: I wish I had said then, as I do now, that the immoralities of white men in their relations with colored women are the source of intolerable race prejudice and hatred, and that there is not a more withering curse upon the manhood of any nation than that which the eternal laws of nature visited upon those men in those homes in which the helpless bondwoman was made the victim of her master\u2019s base desire.140 While Willard continued to claim that Black men posed a sexual threat to white women and girls, she attempted to soften her claims with the acknowledgment that white men also posed a threat to Black women and girls. But, as Mattingly observes, Willard\u2019s condemnation of white men was \u201csituated primarily in the past and associated with the evils of slavery.\u201d141 In effect, Willard was saying that white men may have once posed a threat to Black women and girls, but now it is only Black men who are still dangerous. In response to building pressure, including the condemnation of the WCTU by other prominent Black social justice organizers, the WCTU passed a resolution against lynching in 1895. The resolution stated defensively that the WCTU \u201cought never to have been placed in the position of having to defend themselves from the charge that they favored the lynching of any human being, anywhere, under any circumstances.\u201d142 It also claimed that people \u201cmisrepresented our position,\u201d likely referring to Wells, Ransom, and others who demanded that the WCTU actively and publicly condemn lynching. Coming across this story from about 120 years ago, we recognize the still all-too-familiar pattern within social justice work\n\nChapman, Chris; Withers, A.J.. A Violent History of Benevolence: Interlocking Oppression in the Moral Economies of Social Working (pp. 096-101). University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division. Edi\u00e7\u00e3o do Kindle. and beyond. Rather than deeply reflecting on her position, this white person in a leadership position, and the organization under her direction, dug in their heels and refused to acknowledge the harm they\u2019d caused. The white people thus claimed their own innocence143 and, worse still, depicted themselves as wronged for having been accused of racism. The implication is that the Black community organizers who challenged the organization\u2019s position were overreacting, too sensitive, and too angry \u2013 all of which reaffirms white supremacist anti-Black stereotypes. For this reason, these stories of Wells, Willard, and Addams are not only important as history but also as examples of how people today who claim to be allies need to be reflexive and of when they should defer to the lead of those most directly affected by an issue. Our aim here, with respect to Addams and Willard, is to paint a more complex picture of them \u2013 particularly of Addams. We\u2019re all formed by discourses, practices, and moral economies of interlocking oppression. They shape what we can know, believe, and perceive. It\u2019s not that this shaping is out of the realm of our influence or that either woman is innocent. Recognizing these complexities and holding their positive anti-oppressive practice in tension with the clearly racist, classist, and otherwise oppressive things they did is useful in helping us all understand that we\u2019re complicit in oppression even when working against it. Acknowledging this complicity is a crucial part of critical or anti-oppressive practice.144 Early Black social workers were not perfect either. Like everyone else, they were flawed people with imperfect politics who sometimes did oppressive things and often held problematic views about other people. They were part of the project of social work\u2019s new and politically complicated interventions into the social world, and sometimes this project brought an increase in surveillance, assimilation, classism, cisheterosexism, and social control into Black communities. We don\u2019t want to paint a picture of any of these figures as perfect, because we can only follow in the footsteps of the types of people that we know to have existed. As Davis asks of representations of Martin Luther King, Jr: \u201cHow could you possibly measure up to someone like that?\u201d145 She stresses that the Montgomery bus boycott \u2013 widely considered the birth of the civil rights movement \u2013 was started by ordinary people just like any one of us, and she emphasizes how important it is for us to know this in order to open possibilities for considering what role we might play in fundamental social transformation. Maggie L. Walker and the Independent Order of St Luke Maggie L. Walker\u2019s record of significantly intervening into the social world begins with her participation in what is believed to be the first anti-segregation school strike by Black students in the United States in 1883. She went on to become a teacher and part-time worker at an insurance company and later was hired as the secretary for the Independent Order of St Luke in Richmond, Virginia. The order had been founded in 1867 by former slave Mary Prout in Baltimore.146 Lily Hardy Hammond, writing in 1922, describes the Order of St Luke when Walker first came on board as \u201ca little benefit society in Richmond \u2013 one of probably a dozen or two,\u201d which had around 1,000 members. These societies were commonplace in Black communities where \u201csickness [was] a catastrophe such as only the poorest people can fully comprehend.\u201d The society paid its members out of dues if a member became sick or died, \u201cthus saving the family from what is often, among the very poor, a crushing burden of debt.\u201d147 At a time when nation-states were just beginning to offer workers\u2019 compensation themselves, local collective organizations, included this one started by Prout, acted as a social safety net. Working class people, including Black people and recent immigrants, would cumulatively contribute to a fund, and the collective would then support them from that fund if they needed it.148 The gradual development of private disability, workers\u2019 compensation, and life insurance are commonly described as contributing to the development of the modern welfare state and as a key part of social work history.149 Walker worked to expand services; by 1922, there were 100,000 members with the organization across twenty-one states. Walker also started the St Luke\u2019s Herald, which provided community and organizational news, and covered topics that preoccupied social work publications of the day such as \u201chealth, thrift, morals, and education.\u201d150 The Herald also provided detailed accounts of lynchings, segregation, and racism. The order adopted political positions, including supporting universal suffrage and anti-lynching efforts. It led the Richmond streetcar boycott against segregation in 1904.151 The Independent Order of St Luke created a bank in 1903 under Walker\u2019s direction. Walker thus became the first woman president of a bank in the United States. The bank provided financing for Black people to buy homes and go to college, among other things.152 These funds would have been otherwise difficult or impossible for Black people in the South to obtain. The predominantly circulated history of the credit union is that it was spread by Desjardins to the United States in 1908.153 Credit unions began in Germany, and had begun to be established in Qu\u00e9bec by Alphonse Desjardins in 1900 to help low-income people secure credit. Walker\u2019s bank seems to have been aligned with the ethos of early collectivist credit unions. When such work is undertaken by a disadvantaged racialized group to provide services for those who couldn\u2019t otherwise access them due to racial segregation and rampant poverty, it is a significant intervention into the social world, enabling people to better navigate and mitigate capitalism\u2019s violences. In 1909, Walker wrote that she wished to \u201cturn the course of that almighty stream of dollar, and see if we can till our own barren lands, feed our own hungry, and clothe our own naked.\u201d154 Yet, this bank is not considered part of credit union history. Like many other early women social workers of her time, Walker was also involved in club work. She founded a Richmond Council of Colored Women, which did community service and fundraising.155 When given the opportunity, Walker and other community members fundraised to establish a home for young women, with help from a white philanthropist. According to Walker, \u201cThe white philanthropist \u2026 said that if we colored women would show our interest in social work among our people by raising a thousand dollars for it, he would give us the use of a large house, and if we made good, he would deed it to a board of white and colored women for colored work.\u201d156 In response to this possibility, the community raised the money, and the women established the home. Walker said that white women in Richmond \u201chad done fine community work for white people,\u201d but that, with respect to this project, \u201cthe white women don\u2019t work for us, \u2013 they work with us.\u201d157 Walker worked with whomever was necessary, doing whatever was necessary, to help the Black community of Richmond and, indeed, the whole country. However, if you check the index of any social work text that is not specifically about Black social work, it is almost guaranteed that you won\u2019t find her name there. The Social Work Profession, Social Science, and Education Through the Progressive Era, many professions were not accessible to Black people in Canada and the United States because of the racist, segregationist educational and economic systems. Francille Wilson writes that the only two professions open to Black people were \u201cteaching and preaching,\u201d158 neither of which required a degree at the time. Social work had the potential to be yet another accessible profession for Black people,159 given that it was outside the systems of governing accredited bodies and academic programs (unlike law and medicine, by this time). Decent paid jobs were frequently obtainable for Black social workers in a number of social sectors, although often in segregated agencies or departments.160 The availability of social work jobs may, in part, explain why an increasing number of Black (and white) men entered the profession, which had previously been considered women\u2019s work.161 In fact, differentiating social work from charity often mapped onto differentiating the work that men were doing from that which women had been doing previously.162 An increasing emphasis on the use of social science was present in Black social work at the time. In the late nineteenth century, W.E.B. Du Bois started doing sociological studies of Black communities that served to identify their needs and combat racist notions about them.163 Some social science emphasized the desire to take social work out of the hands of the churches,164 but social science was taken up by social gospellers as well.165 As in white social work, a belief in the importance of systematic and scientific social work was commonly held by Black social workers across the political spectrum during this period.166 Black social workers also developed social work educational programs, with the first undergraduate program beginning in 1911.167 George Haynes, co-founder of the National Urban League (discussed earlier), established the program at Fisk University and advocated that an understanding of Black history was necessary for Black people to conduct effective Black social work.168 Haynes was motivated by the desire to ensure that Black service users were served by Black workers and that Black social workers did not become a professional underclass because they had fewer academic credentials.169 The first social work graduate program at a Black educational institution was established in 1922 at Atlanta\u2019s Morehouse College,170 and several other programs were created around the same time.171 Although social work programs had previously been available in white institutions, they did not teach from a Black perspective or address needs that were considered important in Black communities. Black Social Work in Canada Black social work in Canada has a number of similarities to the US history: churches played a major role in community work, reform efforts, and charity; there was a strong tradition of neighbour-to-neighbour helping and community improvement; and women took on important organizing roles, particularly with respect to schools and anti-slavery organizing.172 However, because Black communities were so much smaller in Canada than in the United States, and because of other factors such as political economy, geography, and climate, there were important differences too. The level of formal organization that occurred in the United States was simply not present in Canadian Black communities during the Progressive Era.173 Nonetheless, Black social work and social workers made important contributions to their communities and to the emerging profession of social work. Canada had a significant Black population for a number of reasons, including its own legacy of slavery, which began in 1628 when the first African slave was brought to what is now called Canada.174 The main sources of Black immigrants to Canada were slaves who accompanied British loyalists during the American Revolution, escaped slaves from Jamaica (known as the Maroons), freemen after the War of 1812, escaped American slaves through the Underground Railroad, and free US Black people trying to avoid American racism.175 Black communities in Canada during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were largely found in Ontario (called Upper Canada, Canada West, and the Province of Canada at various times) and Nova Scotia,176 although there were also notable populations on Vancouver Island177 and in Montr\u00e9al178 and several smaller cities.179 This settlement pattern was largely a product of the proximity of these English-speaking areas to the United States. Some Black settlers also migrated to the western provinces, but the government instituted anti-Black immigration policies before their numbers could rise significantly, as we discuss in chapter 4.180 Many US regions where Black people were legally \u201cfree\u201d had Black Laws or Black Codes, which seriously restricted the freedom and ability of many Black people to settle. This legal framework was yet another reason some Black people immigrated to Canada.181 In 1850, the US government passed the Fugitive Slave Act, allowing for the arrest of any escaped slave anywhere in the United States and requiring that person\u2019s return to their former \u201cowner.\u201d182 In the years following the passage of this act, around 50,000 former slaves* immigrated to Upper Canada.183 (To provide some perspective, the population of Toronto, called York at the time, was only 100,000 in 1841.184) Settlements in Canada A number of settlements were intentionally established as communities for escaped slaves and other Black people seeking a better life outside the pervasive and institutional racism of the United States. While this organizing has not been traditionally depicted as social work, those responsible for these initiatives were clearly engaged in making individuals\u2019 lives better,",

This chapter discusses  examples that deconstruct this framing: the \u201cdirect action casework\u201d practised  by the Ontario Coalition Against Poverty, on the one hand, and the externally  imposed community relocations of Regent Park and Africville, on the other. \nOnly a thin selection of the work of either Addams and Richmond and their  respective movements (settlement houses and COSs) gets gleaned from a much  more complex history, and this partial representation is then held as the found ing, and ongoing, struggle (or harmonious diversity) of social work \u2013 which  also functions to mark out the parameters within which social work inevitably  operates. This chapter problematizes this oversimplification, with the hope that  such a critical examination might impact the way in which today\u2019s social work ers think of themselves, their relationship to history, and their part in creating  what will be known as history tomorrow. \nThe Pull of the Other Side of the River \nRadical iterations of the standard account of social work history follow a pat tern often found in radical analysis. In this pattern, there are very clear dividing  lines between those responsible for oppression and those opposed to, and/or  subjected to, oppression. The pattern is poetically illustrated in The Motorcycle  Diaries,5 a film adaptation of the memoir of the same title by Argentinian Marx ist revolutionary Ernesto \u201cChe\u201d Guevara. Recapping this scene, Miguel Alfonso  Ca\u00f1ero writes: \nAt the San Pablo leper colony, [friends Ernesto and Alberto] spend three weeks  helping treat patients, [and] they learn that the doctors and nurses all stay on one  side of the riverbank and the leper patients on the other. Right away Ernesto and  Alberto break the rules and get in trouble \u2013 they shake hands with the patients  without wearing gloves \u2026 [T]he two friends quickly bond with the patients.6 \nCopyright \u00a9 2019. University of Toronto Press. All rights reserved.\nShortly thereafter, Ernesto swims across the river to celebrate his birthday with  the patients rather than with the doctors, nurses, and ruling class volunteers.  Crossing the river represents his radicalization: he leaves behind the life of a  ruling class medical student and aligns himself with the poor and disadvantaged \u2013  no longer tethered to them through stratified helping in which he is exalted as  morally superior, but symbolically becoming one with them, sharing their space.  His journey across the river is heavy with symbolism. At first only the doctors,  nurses, and other volunteers know what he\u2019s doing. They beg him to come back  for fear that he\u2019ll be swept away or get eaten by animals. Their only response is  panic and fear. Slowly the folks in the leper colony become aware that something",

Without a  doubt, the COS assisted some poor people in certain ways, but it only ever did  so in ways that would also benefit the wealthy and support the political status  quo.

Of the uneven relationship at the time between anti-Black lynching and disablist eugenics, one illustrative event was the murder of a \u201cseventeen year old boy by the name of Jesse Washington \u2026 in 1916,\u201d which is the year after the cornerstone eugenic criminology text, The Criminal Imbecile, was published.108 James Allen says that Jesse Washington was \u201cseriously mentally challenged. The wife of the farmer he worked for was found dead.\u201d109 Jesse was tried and convicted. From Rafter\u2019s history of eugenic criminology, we might expect that Jesse would have been given an indefinite prison sentence, resulting in a eugenically rationalized lifelong incarceration due to his intellectual disability \u2013 although in Texas, where he was killed, he may have been more likely confined to an asylum for his life. Regardless, neither of these things took place. Instead he was dragged out of the courtroom, kicked down the steps, tortured, burned alive, castrated, had his fingers cut off one by one, and hanged. \u201cThere were 16,000 people crowding the street to watch this boy be tortured \u2026 [T]here were cheers, like at a football game, cheering the torturers on.\u201d Perhaps Jesse was partly targeted because he was disabled, but he was publicly tortured and murdered because he was Black.110 Ida B. Wells-Barnett Black communities fought vigorously to abolish lynching. One of the most prominent anti-lynching activists was Ida B. Wells (Wells-Barnett,\u2020 following her marriage).111 She was also a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the National Association of Colored Women, and was active in the women\u2019s club movement. In 1884, she first gained wide recognition for refusing to move from an all-white train car and for winning a settlement against the railroad.112 Wells wrote a condemnation of lynching in Memphis\u2019s Free Speech and Headlight after her friend Tom Moss was lynched for defending himself from white men\u2019s physical attacks in 1892. Due to the response to this condemnation, she was forced to flee the South. She recalls: \u201cIt was for the assertion of this fact, in the defense of her own race, that the writer hereof became an exile; her property destroyed and her return to her home forbidden under penalty of death.\u201d113 Nevertheless, she continued to agitate against lynching. In 1899, she wrote and circulated a pamphlet, \u201cLynch Law in Georgia,\u201d to Black communities in Chicago. She wrote: \u201cThe real purpose of the savage demonstrations is to teach the Negro that in the south he has no rights that the law will enforce. Samuel House was burned to teach the Negroes that no matter what a white man does to them, they must not resist.\u201d114 In response to dominant framings of anti-Black lynching more generally, and specifically to Jane Addams\u2019s acceptance of this normative white framing in her own condemnation of lynching, Wells demonstrated that most lynchings didn\u2019t involve even a claim* that the murdered man had raped a white woman.115 She showed that many of the lynchings committed on the grounds of sexual assault by Black men against white women were actually white responses to consensual interracial relationships, which were considered unacceptable within interlocking white supremacist patriarchal moral economies.116 White men had only recently lost unmitigated sexual access to the Black women they owned in law, regardless of these women\u2019s desires and consent, with the end of slavery.117 The predominant white account of lynching at the time was that white women were regularly raped by Black men, but Andrea Smith challenges the fictitiousness of this narrative: \u201cIn fact, Black women needed protection from white men.\u201d118 Indeed, Wells-Barnett\u2019s grandmother was a slave and her father a slave-owner\u2019s son \u2013 so he was likely a child who resulted from rape, as was common during slavery.119 Although fictitious, the prevalent notion that white men had to lynch Black men in order to save white women from Black rape was so pervasive that Hollywood\u2019s first blockbuster, The Birth of a Nation, which had the highest grossing ticket sales until Gone with the Wind twenty-four years later,120 depicts what claims to be a historical account of post-Civil War reconstruction and glorifies the founding of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) and a lynching in response to a Black man raping a white woman.121 When considering the views of Smith and Wells-Barnett on lynching Black men accused of raping white women, it\u2019s important to note that white men who raped any woman of any race were never lynched. In fact, most often there was no consequence at all. Contemporary readers should remember this point if they find Wells-Barnett\u2019s handling of rape and sexual assault accusations troubling due to having been socialized within second wave feminism\u2019s crucial politicization of sexual assault and the importance of believing those who say they\u2019ve been sexually assaulted. That indispensable lesson needs to be taken into account, alongside a concern about white supremacist framings of Black and racialized men as particularly prone to rape and other patriarchal violence. Of course, even consensual relationships can involve sexual assault \u2013 a point which could be said to become lost within Wells-Barnett\u2019s claim that the issue pertains to race and not sexual assault as the (interracial) relationship was consensual. (That, said, it was not until the 1970s in the United States122 and in 1983 in Canada123 that men could be held legally responsible for raping their wives.) However, it doesn\u2019t appear Wells-Barnett believed that rape never happened. But she was fighting against the ruse by which rape (real or fictitious) was used to excuse lynching. Like many other Black feminists, Wells-Barnett understood how gender and race interlocked, and she fought against this interlocking oppression rather than against racism or sexism in isolation. Carlton-LaNey writes of such anti-lynching work, saying that Black women at the time \u201crecognize[d] the political nature of sexism long before their white counterparts.\u201d Wells-Barnett and other early Black social workers \u201cfaced the fact that sexual exploitation and violence were perpetuated by both African American and white men.\u201d Carlton-LaNey therefore argues that \u201cpoliticizing sexual exploitation and harassment for African American women placed it squarely within the context of race. Combatting sexual exploitation, therefore, was inextricably linked to race uplift.\u201d124 Early anti-racist feminism did not minimize sexism or sexual assault; rather, it politicized sexism, sexual assault, and responses to them in multiple directions. Andrea Smith begins her chapter \u201cSexual Violence as a Tool of Genocide\u201d by troubling Susan Brownmiller\u2019s second wave white feminist assertion that rape \u201cis nothing more or less than a conscious process of intimidation by which all men keep all women in a state of fear.\u201d Smith uses this statement as a springboard to explore how racism and colonialism shape the particulars of what rape is.125 Likewise, Wells-Barnett was centrally concerned with situating rape and rape discourse within what contemporary feminists call interlocking oppression, as evidenced by her repeated discussions of gender and race and, to a lesser extent, class.126 Such early anti-racist feminist understandings of interlocking oppression trouble the common history of feminism in which interlocking analyses are a recent development initiated by Black feminists such as the Combahee River Collective,127 Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw,128 Patricia Hill Collins,129 Angela Davis,130 Audre Lorde,131 and bell hooks.132 Without minimizing the importance of Black feminism since the 1970s (which often honours earlier Black feminist history), the Black feminist struggle to work against interlocking oppression goes back to the first wave of feminism, which is largely left out of white histories of feminism. It\u2019s not that we wish to reduce the importance of recent anti-racist feminist authors and activists; it\u2019s that remembering the earlier anti-racist feminists raises troubling questions about how feminism\u2019s history up to the 1970s came to be recorded as yet another white history. After fleeing the South, Wells-Barnett organized anti-lynching organizations in a number of states.133 These and other anti-lynching campaigns were hugely influential in Black communities in the United States. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) emerged from anti-lynching activists. Founded in 1909 by a mixture of some of the Black community organizers we\u2019re discussing in this chapter \u2013 Wells-Barnett, Terrell, and Du Bois \u2013 and some white activists (including Addams), the NAACP has worked for racial equality for over a century and is still active today.134 White Social Work and Anti-Lynching Addams and Wells-Barnett were contemporaries and allies in numerous political struggles.135 Although Addams was somewhat exceptional (for a white person) for her commitment to anti-racism, including her activism against lynching, she also accepted that aspects of the white supremacist connection between sexual assault and lynching were true. She was a member of the NAACP at the time, yet she felt entitled to do and say things that appear to have been unaccountable to the experiences of Black communities. According to Wilma Peebles-Wilkins and E. Aracelis Francis, Addams \u201cdid not seem to understand that lynchings involved innocent victims and were not just an unacceptable response to crime.\u201d136 Addams accepted the view that Black men posed a threat to white women and white communities, but objected to lynchings on the grounds that they were not an effective deterrent to this kind of violence and punishment for crimes should be left to the legal system. She also wrote that lynchings were effective in reducing crimes committed by Black men because \u201ccertain elements of the self can be prevented from coming into action,\u201d but pointed out that this inhibition was only a temporary fix because these \u201celements of the self\u201d might resurface.137 Addams\u2019s analysis was shaped by her whiteness and her class positioning, by moral economies of white supremacy, and by discourses stressing the importance of the rule of law and Black men\u2019s criminality. Like Addams, Willard of the WCTU also didn\u2019t understand that lynching was used to control and terrorize Black people. The WCTU refused to allow Wells to address its annual national assembly in 1893. The following year, Wells secured the sponsorship of an organization to ensure that she could address the meeting. She wanted to confront the WCTU\u2019s failure to publicly condemn the lynching of Black men.138 Wells\u2019s insistence on confronting Willard and the WCTU was provoked by an 1890 interview in which Willard made several racist comments about Black people. Willard\u2019s remarks included reiterating the notion that Black men pose a threat to the safety of women and children. She said of white Southerners: \u201cThe problem in their hands is immeasurable. The colored race multiplies like the locusts of Egypt. The grog-shop [liquor store] is a center of power. The safety of women, of childhood, of the home is menaced.\u201d139 Willard thus reiterated the frequent justification of lynching due to the supposed threat that Black men posed to white women. It is particularly concerning that one of the earliest organizations combatting violence against women reified the idea that Black men were exceptionally violent towards women and failed to condemn the racist violence of lynching. When Wells identified Willard\u2019s position as untrue and racist, Willard defended her position. However, she added: I wish I had said then, as I do now, that the immoralities of white men in their relations with colored women are the source of intolerable race prejudice and hatred, and that there is not a more withering curse upon the manhood of any nation than that which the eternal laws of nature visited upon those men in those homes in which the helpless bondwoman was made the victim of her master\u2019s base desire.140 While Willard continued to claim that Black men posed a sexual threat to white women and girls, she attempted to soften her claims with the acknowledgment that white men also posed a threat to Black women and girls. But, as Mattingly observes, Willard\u2019s condemnation of white men was \u201csituated primarily in the past and associated with the evils of slavery.\u201d141 In effect, Willard was saying that white men may have once posed a threat to Black women and girls, but now it is only Black men who are still dangerous. In response to building pressure, including the condemnation of the WCTU by other prominent Black social justice organizers, the WCTU passed a resolution against lynching in 1895. The resolution stated defensively that the WCTU \u201cought never to have been placed in the position of having to defend themselves from the charge that they favored the lynching of any human being, anywhere, under any circumstances.\u201d142 It also claimed that people \u201cmisrepresented our position,\u201d likely referring to Wells, Ransom, and others who demanded that the WCTU actively and publicly condemn lynching. Coming across this story from about 120 years ago, we recognize the still all-too-familiar pattern within social justice work\n\nChapman, Chris; Withers, A.J.. A Violent History of Benevolence: Interlocking Oppression in the Moral Economies of Social Working (pp. 096-101). University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division. Edi\u00e7\u00e3o do Kindle. and beyond. Rather than deeply reflecting on her position, this white person in a leadership position, and the organization under her direction, dug in their heels and refused to acknowledge the harm they\u2019d caused. The white people thus claimed their own innocence143 and, worse still, depicted themselves as wronged for having been accused of racism. The implication is that the Black community organizers who challenged the organization\u2019s position were overreacting, too sensitive, and too angry \u2013 all of which reaffirms white supremacist anti-Black stereotypes. For this reason, these stories of Wells, Willard, and Addams are not only important as history but also as examples of how people today who claim to be allies need to be reflexive and of when they should defer to the lead of those most directly affected by an issue. Our aim here, with respect to Addams and Willard, is to paint a more complex picture of them \u2013 particularly of Addams. We\u2019re all formed by discourses, practices, and moral economies of interlocking oppression. They shape what we can know, believe, and perceive. It\u2019s not that this shaping is out of the realm of our influence or that either woman is innocent. Recognizing these complexities and holding their positive anti-oppressive practice in tension with the clearly racist, classist, and otherwise oppressive things they did is useful in helping us all understand that we\u2019re complicit in oppression even when working against it. Acknowledging this complicity is a crucial part of critical or anti-oppressive practice.144 Early Black social workers were not perfect either. Like everyone else, they were flawed people with imperfect politics who sometimes did oppressive things and often held problematic views about other people. They were part of the project of social work\u2019s new and politically complicated interventions into the social world, and sometimes this project brought an increase in surveillance, assimilation, classism, cisheterosexism, and social control into Black communities. We don\u2019t want to paint a picture of any of these figures as perfect, because we can only follow in the footsteps of the types of people that we know to have existed. As Davis asks of representations of Martin Luther King, Jr: \u201cHow could you possibly measure up to someone like that?\u201d145 She stresses that the Montgomery bus boycott \u2013 widely considered the birth of the civil rights movement \u2013 was started by ordinary people just like any one of us, and she emphasizes how important it is for us to know this in order to open possibilities for considering what role we might play in fundamental social transformation. Maggie L. Walker and the Independent Order of St Luke Maggie L. Walker\u2019s record of significantly intervening into the social world begins with her participation in what is believed to be the first anti-segregation school strike by Black students in the United States in 1883. She went on to become a teacher and part-time worker at an insurance company and later was hired as the secretary for the Independent Order of St Luke in Richmond, Virginia. The order had been founded in 1867 by former slave Mary Prout in Baltimore.146 Lily Hardy Hammond, writing in 1922, describes the Order of St Luke when Walker first came on board as \u201ca little benefit society in Richmond \u2013 one of probably a dozen or two,\u201d which had around 1,000 members. These societies were commonplace in Black communities where \u201csickness [was] a catastrophe such as only the poorest people can fully comprehend.\u201d The society paid its members out of dues if a member became sick or died, \u201cthus saving the family from what is often, among the very poor, a crushing burden of debt.\u201d147 At a time when nation-states were just beginning to offer workers\u2019 compensation themselves, local collective organizations, included this one started by Prout, acted as a social safety net. Working class people, including Black people and recent immigrants, would cumulatively contribute to a fund, and the collective would then support them from that fund if they needed it.148 The gradual development of private disability, workers\u2019 compensation, and life insurance are commonly described as contributing to the development of the modern welfare state and as a key part of social work history.149 Walker worked to expand services; by 1922, there were 100,000 members with the organization across twenty-one states. Walker also started the St Luke\u2019s Herald, which provided community and organizational news, and covered topics that preoccupied social work publications of the day such as \u201chealth, thrift, morals, and education.\u201d150 The Herald also provided detailed accounts of lynchings, segregation, and racism. The order adopted political positions, including supporting universal suffrage and anti-lynching efforts. It led the Richmond streetcar boycott against segregation in 1904.151 The Independent Order of St Luke created a bank in 1903 under Walker\u2019s direction. Walker thus became the first woman president of a bank in the United States. The bank provided financing for Black people to buy homes and go to college, among other things.152 These funds would have been otherwise difficult or impossible for Black people in the South to obtain. The predominantly circulated history of the credit union is that it was spread by Desjardins to the United States in 1908.153 Credit unions began in Germany, and had begun to be established in Qu\u00e9bec by Alphonse Desjardins in 1900 to help low-income people secure credit. Walker\u2019s bank seems to have been aligned with the ethos of early collectivist credit unions. When such work is undertaken by a disadvantaged racialized group to provide services for those who couldn\u2019t otherwise access them due to racial segregation and rampant poverty, it is a significant intervention into the social world, enabling people to better navigate and mitigate capitalism\u2019s violences. In 1909, Walker wrote that she wished to \u201cturn the course of that almighty stream of dollar, and see if we can till our own barren lands, feed our own hungry, and clothe our own naked.\u201d154 Yet, this bank is not considered part of credit union history. Like many other early women social workers of her time, Walker was also involved in club work. She founded a Richmond Council of Colored Women, which did community service and fundraising.155 When given the opportunity, Walker and other community members fundraised to establish a home for young women, with help from a white philanthropist. According to Walker, \u201cThe white philanthropist \u2026 said that if we colored women would show our interest in social work among our people by raising a thousand dollars for it, he would give us the use of a large house, and if we made good, he would deed it to a board of white and colored women for colored work.\u201d156 In response to this possibility, the community raised the money, and the women established the home. Walker said that white women in Richmond \u201chad done fine community work for white people,\u201d but that, with respect to this project, \u201cthe white women don\u2019t work for us, \u2013 they work with us.\u201d157 Walker worked with whomever was necessary, doing whatever was necessary, to help the Black community of Richmond and, indeed, the whole country. However, if you check the index of any social work text that is not specifically about Black social work, it is almost guaranteed that you won\u2019t find her name there. The Social Work Profession, Social Science, and Education Through the Progressive Era, many professions were not accessible to Black people in Canada and the United States because of the racist, segregationist educational and economic systems. Francille Wilson writes that the only two professions open to Black people were \u201cteaching and preaching,\u201d158 neither of which required a degree at the time. Social work had the potential to be yet another accessible profession for Black people,159 given that it was outside the systems of governing accredited bodies and academic programs (unlike law and medicine, by this time). Decent paid jobs were frequently obtainable for Black social workers in a number of social sectors, although often in segregated agencies or departments.160 The availability of social work jobs may, in part, explain why an increasing number of Black (and white) men entered the profession, which had previously been considered women\u2019s work.161 In fact, differentiating social work from charity often mapped onto differentiating the work that men were doing from that which women had been doing previously.162 An increasing emphasis on the use of social science was present in Black social work at the time. In the late nineteenth century, W.E.B. Du Bois started doing sociological studies of Black communities that served to identify their needs and combat racist notions about them.163 Some social science emphasized the desire to take social work out of the hands of the churches,164 but social science was taken up by social gospellers as well.165 As in white social work, a belief in the importance of systematic and scientific social work was commonly held by Black social workers across the political spectrum during this period.166 Black social workers also developed social work educational programs, with the first undergraduate program beginning in 1911.167 George Haynes, co-founder of the National Urban League (discussed earlier), established the program at Fisk University and advocated that an understanding of Black history was necessary for Black people to conduct effective Black social work.168 Haynes was motivated by the desire to ensure that Black service users were served by Black workers and that Black social workers did not become a professional underclass because they had fewer academic credentials.169 The first social work graduate program at a Black educational institution was established in 1922 at Atlanta\u2019s Morehouse College,170 and several other programs were created around the same time.171 Although social work programs had previously been available in white institutions, they did not teach from a Black perspective or address needs that were considered important in Black communities. Black Social Work in Canada Black social work in Canada has a number of similarities to the US history: churches played a major role in community work, reform efforts, and charity; there was a strong tradition of neighbour-to-neighbour helping and community improvement; and women took on important organizing roles, particularly with respect to schools and anti-slavery organizing.172 However, because Black communities were so much smaller in Canada than in the United States, and because of other factors such as political economy, geography, and climate, there were important differences too. The level of formal organization that occurred in the United States was simply not present in Canadian Black communities during the Progressive Era.173 Nonetheless, Black social work and social workers made important contributions to their communities and to the emerging profession of social work. Canada had a significant Black population for a number of reasons, including its own legacy of slavery, which began in 1628 when the first African slave was brought to what is now called Canada.174 The main sources of Black immigrants to Canada were slaves who accompanied British loyalists during the American Revolution, escaped slaves from Jamaica (known as the Maroons), freemen after the War of 1812, escaped American slaves through the Underground Railroad, and free US Black people trying to avoid American racism.175 Black communities in Canada during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were largely found in Ontario (called Upper Canada, Canada West, and the Province of Canada at various times) and Nova Scotia,176 although there were also notable populations on Vancouver Island177 and in Montr\u00e9al178 and several smaller cities.179 This settlement pattern was largely a product of the proximity of these English-speaking areas to the United States. Some Black settlers also migrated to the western provinces, but the government instituted anti-Black immigration policies before their numbers could rise significantly, as we discuss in chapter 4.180 Many US regions where Black people were legally \u201cfree\u201d had Black Laws or Black Codes, which seriously restricted the freedom and ability of many Black people to settle. This legal framework was yet another reason some Black people immigrated to Canada.181 In 1850, the US government passed the Fugitive Slave Act, allowing for the arrest of any escaped slave anywhere in the United States and requiring that person\u2019s return to their former \u201cowner.\u201d182 In the years following the passage of this act, around 50,000 former slaves* immigrated to Upper Canada.183 (To provide some perspective, the population of Toronto, called York at the time, was only 100,000 in 1841.184) Settlements in Canada A number of settlements were intentionally established as communities for escaped slaves and other Black people seeking a better life outside the pervasive and institutional racism of the United States. While this organizing has not been traditionally depicted as social work, those responsible for these initiatives were clearly engaged in making individuals\u2019 lives better,\n\nChapman, Chris; Withers, A.J.. A Violent History of Benevolence: Interlocking Oppression in the Moral Economies of Social Working (pp. 101-105). University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division. Edi\u00e7\u00e3o do Kindle. strengthening their communities, and undertaking many efforts that would later be called social work when white people did the same things for recent immigrants from Europe. It should be noted, though, that in spite of Canada\u2019s depiction as a refuge for Black people, many were surprised to find extreme racism in Canada as well.185 This hostility, as well as the difficulty of living off the land, meant that most people in the settlements had very difficult lives. A group of Black people who lived in Cincinnati organized to leave the city and travel to Canada in 1829. Cincinnati was a trading hub with the South, and white power brokers ensured that it was inhospitable to Black people.186 The city enforced the state\u2019s Black Laws, requiring, among other things, that new Black residents pay a $500 bond to ensure that they would be of good behaviour.187 In 1829, massive anti-Black race riots took place in Cincinnati. In an attempt to quell the violence and protect their families and property, about 300 Black men agreed to a government plan to voluntarily go to jail.188 This removal of adult men from the community did not quell the white attacks. However, according to Woodson, when the rioting ended, a number of the men who had surrendered themselves \u201cwere discharged on certificates of nativity, others gave bond for their support and good behavior, a few were dismissed as non-residents, a number of them were discharged by a justice of the Court of Common Pleas, and the rest were held indefinitely.\u201d189 Black men who had voluntarily agreed to be incarcerated in the hopes of staving off white violence were forced into forms of bail bonds, driven from the city, or indefinitely imprisoned. Prior to this incident, a group of local organizers had been planning to create a community in Ontario. The organizers likely chose an isolated rural area because they wanted to protect their community from white racism and aspired to achieve economic self-sufficiency.190 The numbers swelled after the riot; somewhere between 460 and 2,000 people fled to Canada. They settled in a community they called Wilberforce, near London, Ontario.191 Over the next decade, a school, stores, and farms were established. Wilberforce is depicted as a failure in the historical literature, but Nikki Taylor notes that the settlement met its original goal of independence.192 One of the reasons it was ultimately unsustainable was that the Canada Land Company, the Crown corporation that sold land to settlers, stopped selling land to Black settlers due to protests from white settlers in the region and the common white supremacist belief that Black people were not reliable enough to uphold their contracts.* In comparison to other settlements, Wilberforce was thus quite short lived. Yet, it provided an escape for many people fleeing racist violence and the Black Codes. Another settlement established near Windsor by the Refugee Home Society was founded in 1851,193 the year after the Fugitive Slave Act was passed and a mass exodus from the United States to Canada began in response. The Refugee Home Society offered a land-granting program with a systematic approach for providing assistance. Fugitive slaves were granted land (twenty-five acres, five acres of which were free). Settlers were then given nine years to pay for the remaining land, and the profits from the venture went into operating a school and continuing the organization\u2019s work, such as buying more land.194 One of the men credited with founding the Refugee Home Society is Henry Bibb. According to Fred Landon, Bibb believed that \u201cthe future of the people of color in Canada depended upon getting them settled on the land and his mind turned to the possibilities of establishing a distinctly Negro colony.\u201d195 For Bibb and the many Black people who lived in, organized, and supported Black colonies, this venture was a liberatory project. For the people who found refuge in Canada, it was also a liberatory project. Yet, while this designation is straightforwardly true, these Black people were also setting up colonies within a white settler colony. Celebrating Bibb in 1920, Landon titled his article \u201cHenry Bibb, a Colonizer.\u201d Bibb saw his chance for freedom for himself and his community as an active part of the colonial process. What was justice for his community helped sustain an injustice for another. Noticing how this one intensely oppressed group was complicit in the oppression of Indigenous people is, by no means, an attempt to undermine the horrors of slavery, including kidnapping, rape, enslavement, torture, and murder. Escaped slaves and other Black people were not wrong to flee to Canada. It was necessary for self-preservation, born of a context in which Black people had mostly come to the Americas through the brutality of the transatlantic slave trade. Bibb\u2019s colonizing can therefore be clearly distinguished from Europeans\u2019 choice to become part of the colonial project. However, it complicates things that former slaves adopted the role of settler. As Sunera Thobani describes, the colonial context of Canada (and the United States) results in any settlement and citizenship being complicit in the continued dispossession of Indigenous peoples\u2019 lands and sovereignty.196 Importantly, she notes this complicity alongside a careful study of the racism experienced by racialized immigrants in Canada, and she suggests that unless fundamental change is made at the level of what the nation is and its relationship to Indigenous communities and nations, the colonial complicity of all settlers remains an unresolvable dilemma. Mahmood says that agency lies not only in resisting social norms but also in how one inhabits norms. Whether in relation to Black women following the mores of separate spheres or escaped slaves taking up the work of colonization, clearly only so many options were available to long-denigrated peoples to enable them to survive and perform respectability. They may have reinforced oppressive mores and underlying moral economies of human value by doing what they did, but perhaps this contradiction might serve to invite us to reflect upon how each of us today uniquely inhabits oppressive mores, outside the simple framings of resistance versus complicity.197 Like many others, Bibb escaped slavery by becoming a colonizer. To complicate matters even further, the \u201cowner\u201d from whom he escaped was Indigenous.* Bibb wrote of his former slave master: \u201cHe was the most reasonable, and humane slaveholder that I have ever belonged to.\u201d He wrote that he would rather be owned by an Indigenous person than a white person.198 Yet, he was nevertheless this other man\u2019s legal property. Encouraging slave ownership was a US government tactic of assimilating Indigenous people in the South;199 it was a way Indigenous people were encouraged to inhabit \u201ccivilized\u201d mores. Certainly, some Indigenous people having owned slaves does nothing to cancel out or trump colonial injustices. Furthermore, Indigenous nations\u2019 responses to Black slavery were as diverse as the nations themselves. The Cherokee nation is said to have engaged in the most extensive Black slave ownership of all Indigenous groups: by the 1860s, the 17,000 members of the Cherokee nation owned 4,000 Black slaves.\u2020 The Seminole and Tuscarora nations, in contrast, provided safe haven for escaped slaves, resulting in many mixed relationships.200 Indigenous people had also been forced into slavery by Europeans and white settlers, starting with Columbus in 1492.201 Alan Gallay estimates that the British were involved in the slave trade of 30,000 to 50,000 Indigenous people in the United States by 1715.202 The practice of enslaving Indigenous people, however, was largely abandoned in the United States by 1720, in part because of militant resistance on the part of Indigenous nations.203 In telling Bibb\u2019s story, we hope to invite consideration of just how complex these histories are, rather than point fingers here or there. Bibb was a fugitive slave who, like so many slaves, was the son of a slave mother and a white father,204 and was likely conceived through the rape of his mother. He had been owned by a First Nations man on colonized land. Bibb escaped when his Indigenous master died, and went on to become a colonizer, purchasing land from the same British Crown that had stolen the land from Indigenous peoples across what\u2019s now called Canada and the United States. He did so to provide safe haven for other escaped slaves. Bibb was a social worker who contributed to founding an organization that helped his community secure basic freedom, education, and security. Bibb\u2019s story illustrates the intensity with which histories of slavery, colonialism, patriarchy, and social work interlock. When this social worker intervened in one political problem that was most pressing for him, he couldn\u2019t help but actively participate in another. Perhaps, in limitless variations, this complexity is the history of social work. Anti-Slavery Societies and Black Immigrant Assistance The earliest Black social work focused largely on assisting people who escaped slavery and fled to Canada, often with no money, no food, and no spare clothing. Rather than imagining this work to be exceptionally \u201cparticular\u201d to Black communities and therefore irrelevant to the subsequent development of social work more generally, we should look on it as work that helped to meet the needs of a group of people who were struggling as a result of unjust social conditions (as can be said of many social workings today and in the past). There was no state assistance for fugitive slaves (with the exception of Black people who emigrated after the War of 1812 and had assisted the British forces, who were given land).205 In response to this socially constituted need, a massive voluntary effort was undertaken to assist escaped slaves, which involved Black and white people collaborating in anti-slavery and liberation societies.206 These groups helped people find jobs, provided food and other resources, and more generally did the work that would later be called social work when undertaken in an organized way within poor white migrant communities. They also crossed national boundaries, just as later professional social work would do;207 for example, the American Anti-Slavery Society sent agents across the border to Canada to assist escaped slaves.208 These organizations fostered an ethos of mutual aid. Many of the people providing and organizing support were escaped slaves who had established themselves in Canada.209 Organizations like the Fugitives\u2019 Home and the Windsor Anti-Slavery Society were founded and run by fugitive slaves determined to assist other fugitives.210 Several were run by Black women, including the Ladies Freedman\u2019s Aid Society, the Ladies Colored Fugitive Association, and the Toronto Ladies\u2019 Association for the Relief of Destitute Colored Fugitives.211 Sharing the sensibility of what would soon be called social work, these organizations often believed that indiscriminate relief was bad and that aid should be restricted and controlled. For instance, the 1853 report of the Canada Anti-Slavery Society says: \u201cAll that able-bodied men and women require is a fair chance, friendly advice, and a little encouragement, perhaps a little assistance at first. Those who are really willing to work can procure employment in a short time after their arrival.\u201d212 While the fugitive relief effort was carried out on a massive scale, individual aid was often restricted, due to prevalent discourses of liberalism, capitalism, and scientific charity. It also bears repeating, yet again, that such relief efforts later run by white people for recent immigrants from Europe is called the origin of social work. Social Services A number of social work and social service projects were organized by members of Black communities in order to assist others in their communities. While some white people were also involved in helping escaped slaves, charitable and social services were segregated in Canada. Edward Lee and Ilyan Ferrer describe \u201csystemic exclusion from white social work institutions\u201d for the Black community.213 They also argue that \u201cthe exclusionary logic of the colour line was reflective of how communities of colour were racially segregated within the Canadian urban geography and provides further explanation as to why they were unable to access the white dominant charity or social settlement movements.\u201d The community building, aid, organizing, and advocacy that Black people did (and continue to do) are very clearly within the realm of what is considered social work, even though it has not been recognized as such in social work history: Elizabeth Jackson Shadd Shreve travelled through Southern Ontario forests to visit sick people and deliver food and clothing to those without;214 and Black people created youth groups, housing cooperatives, and political organizations like the Nova Scotia Association for the Advancement of Coloured People and the National Black Coalition in Nova Scotia.215 Benevolence clubs were also an important site of social service delivery and community building. One of the most prominent was called the True Band Society, which organized to create Black community self-sufficiency.216 The first True Band was founded in Amherstburg, Ontario (near Windsor), in 1854.217 Like the Provincial Union Association founded the same year, it worked to create and support Black community self-sufficiency.218 The True Bands provided resources to poor Black families, provided care for sick people, supported schools, and worked to resolve conflicts among community members.219 By 1856, there were",
