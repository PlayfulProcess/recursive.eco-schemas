  "description": "Based on Robert Plutchik's psychoevolutionary theory of emotion (1927-2006). Eight primary emotions arranged in opposing pairs, with three intensity levels each. Dyads (compound emotions) emerge from adjacent primary emotions. Plutchik studied emotions across species, revealing their evolutionary basis in survival.",
