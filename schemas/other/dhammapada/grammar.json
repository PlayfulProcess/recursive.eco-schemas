Only the water of love (metta, loving-kindness) extinguishes it. This is not naive idealism but practical psychology: meeting aggression with aggression escalates; meeting it with compassion disarms. The Buddha calls this 'an old rule' — eternal, discovered anew in every generation.",

What quarrel can survive the knowledge of impermanence?",

Without discipline, without purpose beyond the next pleasure, you become vulnerable to every passing wind.",

But now, maker of the tabernacle, thou hast been seen; thou shalt not make up this tabernacle again. All thy rafters are broken, thy ridge-pole is sundered; the mind, approaching the Eternal (visankhara, nirvana), has attained to the extinction of all desires.",
        "Interpretation": "Traditionally the Buddha's exclamation at the moment of enlightenment. The 'maker of the tabernacle' is craving itself — the force that constructs the body of suffering life after life. Finding and seeing the maker means understanding the root of rebirth. The rafters (defilements) are broken, the ridge-pole (ignorance) sundered. The house of self will not be rebuilt. This is the most intimate and triumphant verse in the entire Dhammapada.",

Therefore let no man be an itinerant mendicant and he will not be beset with pain.",
        "Interpretation": "A strikingly honest verse about the difficulty of every option: worldly life is hard, monastic life is hard, living with others is hard, wandering alone is hard. There is no pain-free option. The final line is ironic — 'let no man be a mendicant and he will not be beset with pain' — because the preceding verses have shown that all options involve pain. The teaching is: choose your pain wisely.",

        "Verse": "They who know what is forbidden as forbidden, and what is not forbidden as not forbidden, such men, embracing the true doctrine, enter the good path.",
        "Interpretation": "The chapter's only positive verse and its resolution: right perception of what is and is not forbidden. When shame, fear, and prohibition are correctly aligned with reality, you are on the good path. This verse is the mirror image of the three inversions (316-318): get these three right, and everything follows. Correct moral perception is the foundation of the good life.",
        "Reversed": "Rigid moralism that leaves no room for nuance. Knowing what is truly forbidden requires wisdom, not just rule-following."
