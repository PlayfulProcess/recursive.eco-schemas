Only the water of love (metta, loving-kindness) extinguishes it. This is not naive idealism but practical psychology: meeting aggression with aggression escalates; meeting it with compassion disarms. The Buddha calls this 'an old rule' — eternal, discovered anew in every generation.",

What quarrel can survive the knowledge of impermanence?",

Without discipline, without purpose beyond the next pleasure, you become vulnerable to every passing wind.",

But now, maker of the tabernacle, thou hast been seen; thou shalt not make up this tabernacle again. All thy rafters are broken, thy ridge-pole is sundered; the mind, approaching the Eternal (visankhara, nirvana), has attained to the extinction of all desires.",
        "Interpretation": "Traditionally the Buddha's exclamation at the moment of enlightenment. The 'maker of the tabernacle' is craving itself — the force that constructs the body of suffering life after life. Finding and seeing the maker means understanding the root of rebirth. The rafters (defilements) are broken, the ridge-pole (ignorance) sundered. The house of self will not be rebuilt. This is the most intimate and triumphant verse in the entire Dhammapada.",
