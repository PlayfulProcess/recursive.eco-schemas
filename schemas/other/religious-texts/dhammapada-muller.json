  "description": "The Dhammapada ('Path of the Dharma') is one of the best-known texts from the Pali Canon, the scriptures of Theravada Buddhism. Its 423 verses in 26 chapters distill the essence of the Buddha's teaching into practical wisdom on ethics, mind, and liberation. This is the classic translation by F. Max Müller (1881) from the Sacred Books of the East.",

        "Text": "1. All that we are is the result of what we have thought: it is founded\non our thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts. If a man speaks or acts\nwith an evil thought, pain follows him, as the wheel follows the foot of\nthe ox that draws the carriage.\n\n2. All that we are is the result of what we have thought: it is founded\non our thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts. If a man speaks or acts\nwith a pure thought, happiness follows him, like a shadow that never\nleaves him.\n\n3. \"He abused me, he beat me, he defeated me, he robbed me,\"--in those\nwho harbour such thoughts hatred will never cease.\n\n4. \"He abused me, he beat me, he defeated me, he robbed me,\"--in those\nwho do not harbour such thoughts hatred will cease.\n\n5. For hatred does not cease by hatred at any time: hatred ceases by\nlove, this is an old rule.\n\n6. The world does not know that we must all come to an end here;--but\nthose who know it, their quarrels cease at once.\n\n7. He who lives looking for pleasures only, his senses uncontrolled,\nimmoderate in his food, idle, and weak, Mara (the tempter) will\ncertainly overthrow him, as the wind throws down a weak tree.\n\n8. He who lives without looking for pleasures, his senses well\ncontrolled, moderate in his food, faithful and strong, him Mara will\ncertainly not overthrow, any more than the wind throws down a rocky\nmountain.\n\n9. He who wishes to put on the yellow dress without having cleansed\nhimself from sin, who disregards temperance and truth, is unworthy of\nthe yellow dress.\n\n10. But he who has cleansed himself from sin, is well grounded in all\nvirtues, and regards also temperance and truth, he is indeed worthy of\nthe yellow dress.\n\n11. They who imagine truth in untruth, and see untruth in truth, never\narrive at truth, but follow vain desires.\n\n12. They who know truth in truth, and untruth in untruth, arrive at\ntruth, and follow true desires.\n\n13. As rain breaks through an ill-thatched house, passion will break\nthrough an unreflecting mind.\n\n14. As rain does not break through a well-thatched house, passion will\nnot break through a well-reflecting mind.\n\n15. The evil-doer mourns in this world, and he mourns in the next; he\nmourns in both. He mourns and suffers when he sees the evil of his own\nwork.\n\n16. The virtuous man delights in this world, and he delights in the\nnext; he delights in both. He delights and rejoices, when he sees the\npurity of his own work.\n\n17. The evil-doer suffers in this world, and he suffers in the next; he\nsuffers in both. He suffers when he thinks of the evil he has done; he\nsuffers more when going on the evil path.\n\n18. The virtuous man is happy in this world, and he is happy in the\nnext; he is happy in both. He is happy when he thinks of the good he has\ndone; he is still more happy when going on the good path.\n\n19. The thoughtless man, even if he can recite a large portion (of the\nlaw), but is not a doer of it, has no share in the priesthood, but is\nlike a cowherd counting the cows of others.\n\n20. The follower of the law, even if he can recite only a small portion\n(of the law), but, having forsaken passion and hatred and foolishness,\npossesses true knowledge and serenity of mind, he, caring for nothing in\nthis world or that to come, has indeed a share in the priesthood."

Those who are in earnest do not die, those who are\nthoughtless are as if dead already.\n\n22. Those who are advanced in earnestness, having understood this\nclearly, delight in earnestness, and rejoice in the knowledge of the\nAriyas (the elect).\n\n23. These wise people, meditative, steady, always possessed of strong\npowers, attain to Nirvana, the highest happiness.\n\n24. If an earnest person has roused himself, if he is not forgetful,\nif his deeds are pure, if he acts with consideration, if he restrains\nhimself, and lives according to law,--then his glory will increase.\n\n25. By rousing himself, by earnestness, by restraint and control, the\nwise man may make for himself an island which no flood can overwhelm.\n\n26. Fools follow after vanity, men of evil wisdom. The wise man keeps\nearnestness as his best jewel.\n\n27. Follow not after vanity, nor after the enjoyment of love and lust!\nHe who is earnest and meditative, obtains ample joy.\n\n28. When the learned man drives away vanity by earnestness, he, the\nwise, climbing the terraced heights of wisdom, looks down upon the\nfools, serene he looks upon the toiling crowd, as one that stands on a\nmountain looks down upon them that stand upon the plain.\n\n29. Earnest among the thoughtless, awake among the sleepers, the wise\nman advances like a racer, leaving behind the hack.\n\n30. By earnestness did Maghavan (Indra) rise to the lordship of the\ngods. People praise earnestness; thoughtlessness is always blamed.\n\n31. A Bhikshu (mendicant) who delights in earnestness, who looks with\nfear on thoughtlessness, moves about like fire, burning all his fetters,\nsmall or large.\n\n32. A Bhikshu (mendicant) who delights in reflection, who looks with\nfear on thoughtlessness, cannot fall away (from his perfect state)--he\nis close upon Nirvana."

The disciple will find out the plainly shown path of\nvirtue, as a clever man finds out the (right) flower.\n\n46. He who knows that this body is like froth, and has learnt that it\nis as unsubstantial as a mirage, will break the flower-pointed arrow of\nMara, and never see the king of death.\n\n47. Death carries off a man who is gathering flowers and whose mind is\ndistracted, as a flood carries off a sleeping village.\n\n48. Death subdues a man who is gathering flowers, and whose mind is\ndistracted, before he is satiated in his pleasures.\n\n49. As the bee collects nectar and departs without injuring the flower,\nor its colour or scent, so let a sage dwell in his village.\n\n50. Not the perversities of others, not their sins of commission or\nomission, but his own misdeeds and negligences should a sage take notice\nof.\n\n51. Like a beautiful flower, full of colour, but without scent, are the\nfine but fruitless words of him who does not act accordingly.\n\n52. But, like a beautiful flower, full of colour and full of scent, are\nthe fine and fruitful words of him who acts accordingly.\n\n53. As many kinds of wreaths can be made from a heap of flowers, so many\ngood things may be achieved by a mortal when once he is born.\n\n54. The scent of flowers does not travel against the wind, nor (that\nof) sandal-wood, or of Tagara and Mallika flowers; but the odour of good\npeople travels even against the wind; a good man pervades every place.\n\n55. Sandal-wood or Tagara, a lotus-flower, or a Vassiki, among these\nsorts of perfumes, the perfume of virtue is unsurpassed.\n\n56. Mean is the scent that comes from Tagara and sandal-wood;--the\nperfume of those who possess virtue rises up to the gods as the highest.\n\n57. Of the people who possess these virtues, who live without\nthoughtlessness, and who are emancipated through true knowledge, Mara,\nthe tempter, never finds the way.\n\n58, 59. As on a heap of rubbish cast upon the highway the lily will\ngrow full of sweet perfume and delight, thus the disciple of the truly\nenlightened Buddha shines forth by his knowledge among those who are\nlike rubbish, among the people that walk in darkness."

He himself does not belong to himself; how\nmuch less sons and wealth?\n\n63. The fool who knows his foolishness, is wise at least so far. But a\nfool who thinks himself wise, he is called a fool indeed.\n\n64. If a fool be associated with a wise man even all his life, he will\nperceive the truth as little as a spoon perceives the taste of soup.\n\n65. If an intelligent man be associated for one minute only with a wise\nman, he will soon perceive the truth, as the tongue perceives the taste\nof soup.\n\n66.

No, that deed is well done of which a man does not repent, and the\nreward of which he receives gladly and cheerfully.\n\n69. As long as the evil deed done does not bear fruit, the fool thinks\nit is like honey; but when it ripens, then the fool suffers grief.\n\n70. Let a fool month after month eat his food (like an ascetic) with the\ntip of a blade of Kusa grass, yet he is not worth the sixteenth particle\nof those who have well weighed the law.\n\n71. An evil deed, like newly-drawn milk, does not turn (suddenly);\nsmouldering, like fire covered by ashes, it follows the fool.\n\n72. And when the evil deed, after it has become known, brings sorrow to\nthe fool, then it destroys his bright lot, nay, it cleaves his head.\n\n73. Let the fool wish for a false reputation, for precedence among the\nBhikshus, for lordship in the convents, for worship among other people!\n\n74. \"May both the layman and he who has left the world think that this\nis done by me; may they be subject to me in everything which is to be\ndone or is not to be done,\" thus is the mind of the fool, and his desire\nand pride increase.\n\n75. \"One is the road that leads to wealth, another the road that leads\nto Nirvana;\" if the Bhikshu, the disciple of Buddha, has learnt this,\nhe will not yearn for honour, he will strive after separation from the\nworld."

Speak the truth, do not yield to anger; give, if thou art asked for\nlittle; by these three steps thou wilt go near the gods.\n\n225. The sages who injure nobody, and who always control their body,\nthey will go to the unchangeable place (Nirvana), where, if they have\ngone, they will suffer no more.\n\n226. Those who are ever watchful, who study day and night, and who\nstrive after Nirvana, their passions will come to an end.\n\n227. This is an old saying, O Atula, this is not only of to-day: `They\nblame him who sits silent, they blame him who speaks much, they also\nblame him who says little; there is no one on earth who is not blamed.'\n\n228. There never was, there never will be, nor is there now, a man who\nis always blamed, or a man who is always praised.\n\n229, 230. But he whom those who discriminate praise continually day\nafter day, as without blemish, wise, rich in knowledge and virtue, who\nwould dare to blame him, like a coin made of gold from the Gambu river?\nEven the gods praise him, he is praised even by Brahman.\n\n231. Beware of bodily anger, and control thy body! Leave the sins of the\nbody, and with thy body practise virtue!\n\n232. Beware of the anger of the tongue, and control thy tongue! Leave\nthe sins of the tongue, and practise virtue with thy tongue!\n\n233. Beware of the anger of the mind, and control thy mind! Leave the\nsins of the mind, and practise virtue with thy mind!\n\n234. The wise who control their body, who control their tongue, the wise\nwho control their mind, are indeed well controlled."

Thou art now like a sear leaf, the messengers of death (Yama) have\ncome near to thee; thou standest at the door of thy departure, and thou\nhast no provision for thy journey.\n\n236. Make thyself an island, work hard, be wise! When thy impurities\nare blown away, and thou art free from guilt, thou wilt enter into the\nheavenly world of the elect (Ariya).\n\n237. Thy life has come to an end, thou art come near to death (Yama),\nthere is no resting-place for thee on the road, and thou hast no\nprovision for thy journey.\n\n238. Make thyself an island, work hard, be wise! When thy impurities are\nblown away, and thou art free from guilt, thou wilt not enter again into\nbirth and decay.\n\n239. Let a wise man blow off the impurities of his self, as a smith\nblows off the impurities of silver one by one, little by little, and\nfrom time to time.\n\n240. As the impurity which springs from the iron, when it springs from\nit, destroys it; thus do a transgressor's own works lead him to the evil\npath.\n\n241. The taint of prayers is non-repetition; the taint of houses,\nnon-repair; the taint of the body is sloth; the taint of a watchman,\nthoughtlessness.\n\n242. Bad conduct is the taint of woman, greediness the taint of a\nbenefactor; tainted are all evil ways in this world and in the next.\n\n243. But there is a taint worse than all taints,--ignorance is\nthe greatest taint. O mendicants! throw off that taint, and become\ntaintless!\n\n244. Life is easy to live for a man who is without shame, a crow hero, a\nmischief-maker, an insulting, bold, and wretched fellow.\n\n245. But life is hard to live for a modest man, who always looks for\nwhat is pure, who is disinterested, quiet, spotless, and intelligent.\n\n246. He who destroys life, who speaks untruth, who in this world takes\nwhat is not given him, who goes to another man's wife;\n\n247. And the man who gives himself to drinking intoxicating liquors, he,\neven in this world, digs up his own root.\n\n248. O man, know this, that the unrestrained are in a bad state; take\ncare that greediness and vice do not bring thee to grief for a long\ntime!\n\n249. The world gives according to their faith or according to their\npleasure: if a man frets about the food and the drink given to others,\nhe will find no rest either by day or by night.\n\n250. He in whom that feeling is destroyed, and taken out with the very\nroot, finds rest by day and by night.\n\n251. There is no fire like passion, there is no shark like hatred, there\nis no snare like folly, there is no torrent like greed.\n\n252. The fault of others is easily perceived, but that of oneself is\ndifficult to perceive; a man winnows his neighbour's faults like chaff,\nbut his own fault he hides, as a cheat hides the bad die from the\ngambler.\n\n253. If a man looks after the faults of others, and is always inclined\nto be offended, his own passions will grow, and he is far from the\ndestruction of passions.\n\n254. There is no path through the air, a man is not a Samana by outward\nacts. The world delights in vanity, the Tathagatas (the Buddhas) are\nfree from vanity.\n\n255. There is no path through the air, a man is not a Samana by outward\nacts. No creatures are eternal; but the awakened (Buddha) are never\nshaken."

A man is not a mendicant (Bhikshu) simply because he asks others\nfor alms; he who adopts the whole law is a Bhikshu, not he who only\nbegs.\n\n267. He who is above good and evil, who is chaste, who with knowledge\npasses through the world, he indeed is called a Bhikshu.\n\n268, 269. A man is not a Muni because he observes silence (mona, i.e.\nmauna), if he is foolish and ignorant; but the wise who, taking the\nbalance, chooses the good and avoids evil, he is a Muni, and is a Muni\nthereby; he who in this world weighs both sides is called a Muni.\n\n270. A man is not an elect (Ariya) because he injures living creatures;\nbecause he has pity on all living creatures, therefore is a man called\nAriya.\n\n271, 272. Not only by discipline and vows, not only by much learning,\nnot by entering into a trance, not by sleeping alone, do I earn the\nhappiness of release which no worldling can know. Bhikshu, be not\nconfident as long as thou hast not attained the extinction of desires."

When you have cut down both the forest (of\nlust) and its undergrowth, then, Bhikshus, you will be rid of the forest\nand free!\n\n284. So long as the love of man towards women, even the smallest, is not\ndestroyed, so long is his mind in bondage, as the calf that drinks milk\nis to its mother.\n\n285. Cut out the love of self, like an autumn lotus, with thy hand!\nCherish the road of peace. Nirvana has been shown by Sugata (Buddha).\n\n286. `Here I shall dwell in the rain, here in winter and summer,' thus\nthe fool meditates, and does not think of his death.\n\n287. Death comes and carries off that man, praised for his children and\nflocks, his mind distracted, as a flood carries off a sleeping village.\n\n288. Sons are no help, nor a father, nor relations; there is no help\nfrom kinsfolk for one whom death has seized.\n\n289. A wise and good man who knows the meaning of this, should quickly\nclear the way that leads to Nirvana."

That fetter wise people call strong which drags down, yields, but\nis difficult to undo; after having cut this at last, people leave the\nworld, free from cares, and leaving desires and pleasures behind.\n\n347. Those who are slaves to passions, run down with the stream (of\ndesires), as a spider runs down the web which he has made himself;\nwhen they have cut this, at last, wise people leave the world free from\ncares, leaving all affection behind.\n\n348. Give up what is before, give up what is behind, give up what is in\nthe middle, when thou goest to the other shore of existence; if thy mind\nis altogether free, thou wilt not again enter into birth and decay.\n\n349. If a man is tossed about by doubts, full of strong passions, and\nyearning only for what is delightful, his thirst will grow more and\nmore, and he will indeed make his fetters strong.\n\n350. If a man delights in quieting doubts, and, always reflecting,\ndwells on what is not delightful (the impurity of the body, &c.), he\ncertainly will remove, nay, he will cut the fetter of Mara.\n\n351. He who has reached the consummation, who does not tremble, who is\nwithout thirst and without sin, he has broken all the thorns of life:\nthis will be his last body.\n\n352. He who is without thirst and without affection, who understands the\nwords and their interpretation, who knows the order of letters (those\nwhich are before and which are after), he has received his last body, he\nis called the great sage, the great man.\n\n353. `I have conquered all, I know all, in all conditions of life I am\nfree from taint; I have left all, and through the destruction of thirst\nI am free; having learnt myself, whom shall I teach?'\n\n354. The gift of the law exceeds all gifts; the sweetness of the law\nexceeds all sweetness; the delight in the law exceeds all delights; the\nextinction of thirst overcomes all pain.\n\n355. Pleasures destroy the foolish, if they look not for the other\nshore; the foolish by his thirst for pleasures destroys himself, as if\nhe were his own enemy.\n\n356. The fields are damaged by weeds, mankind is damaged by passion:\ntherefore a gift bestowed on the passionless brings great reward.\n\n357. The fields are damaged by weeds, mankind is damaged by hatred:\ntherefore a gift bestowed on those who do not hate brings great reward.\n\n358. The fields are damaged by weeds, mankind is damaged by vanity:\ntherefore a gift bestowed on those who are free from vanity brings great\nreward.\n\n359. The fields are damaged by weeds, mankind is damaged by lust:\ntherefore a gift bestowed on those who are free from lust brings great\nreward."

In the body restraint is good, good is restraint in speech, in\nthought restraint is good, good is restraint in all things. A Bhikshu,\nrestrained in all things, is freed from all pain.\n\n362. He who controls his hand, he who controls his feet, he who controls\nhis speech, he who is well controlled, he who delights inwardly, who is\ncollected, who is solitary and content, him they call Bhikshu.\n\n363. The Bhikshu who controls his mouth, who speaks wisely and calmly,\nwho teaches the meaning and the law, his word is sweet.\n\n364. He who dwells in the law, delights in the law, meditates on the\nlaw, follows the law, that Bhikshu will never fall away from the true\nlaw.\n\n365. Let him not despise what he has received, nor ever envy others: a\nmendicant who envies others does not obtain peace of mind.\n\n366. A Bhikshu who, though he receives little, does not despise what he\nhas received, even the gods will praise him, if his life is pure, and if\nhe is not slothful.\n\n367. He who never identifies himself with name and form, and does not\ngrieve over what is no more, he indeed is called a Bhikshu.\n\n368. The Bhikshu who acts with kindness, who is calm in the doctrine\nof Buddha, will reach the quiet place (Nirvana), cessation of natural\ndesires, and happiness.\n\n369. O Bhikshu, empty this boat! if emptied, it will go quickly; having\ncut off passion and hatred thou wilt go to Nirvana.\n\n370. Cut off the five (senses), leave the five, rise above the five. A\nBhikshu, who has escaped from the five fetters, he is called Oghatinna,\n`saved from the flood.'\n\n371. Meditate, O Bhikshu, and be not heedless! Do not direct thy thought\nto what gives pleasure that thou mayest not for thy heedlessness have to\nswallow the iron ball (in hell), and that thou mayest not cry out when\nburning, `This is pain.'\n\n372. Without knowledge there is no meditation, without meditation\nthere is no knowledge: he who has knowledge and meditation is near unto\nNirvana.\n\n373. A Bhikshu who has entered his empty house, and whose mind is\ntranquil, feels a more than human delight when he sees the law clearly.\n\n374. As soon as he has considered the origin and destruction of the\nelements (khandha) of the body, he finds happiness and joy which belong\nto those who know the immortal (Nirvana).\n\n375. And this is the beginning here for a wise Bhikshu: watchfulness\nover the senses, contentedness, restraint under the law; keep noble\nfriends whose life is pure, and who are not slothful.\n\n376. Let him live in charity, let him be perfect in his duties; then in\nthe fulness of delight he will make an end of suffering.\n\n377. As the Vassika plant sheds its withered flowers, men should shed\npassion and hatred, O ye Bhikshus!\n\n378. The Bhikshu whose body and tongue and mind are quieted, who is\ncollected, and has rejected the baits of the world, he is called quiet.\n\n379. Rouse thyself by thyself, examine thyself by thyself, thus\nself-protected and attentive wilt thou live happily, O Bhikshu!\n\n380. For self is the lord of self, self is the refuge of self; therefore\ncurb thyself as the merchant curbs a good horse.\n\n381. The Bhikshu, full of delight, who is calm in the doctrine of Buddha\nwill reach the quiet place (Nirvana), cessation of natural desires, and\nhappiness.\n\n382. He who, even as a young Bhikshu, applies himself to the doctrine of\nBuddha, brightens up this world, like the moon when free from clouds."

        "Text": "383. Stop the stream valiantly, drive away the desires, O Brahmana!\nWhen you have understood the destruction of all that was made, you will\nunderstand that which was not made.\n\n384. If the Brahmana has reached the other shore in both laws (in\nrestraint and contemplation), all bonds vanish from him who has obtained\nknowledge.\n\n385. He for whom there is neither this nor that shore, nor both, him,\nthe fearless and unshackled, I call indeed a Brahmana.\n\n386. He who is thoughtful, blameless, settled, dutiful, without\npassions, and who has attained the highest end, him I call indeed a\nBrahmana.\n\n387. The sun is bright by day, the moon shines by night, the warrior\nis bright in his armour, the Brahmana is bright in his meditation; but\nBuddha, the Awakened, is bright with splendour day and night.\n\n388. Because a man is rid of evil, therefore he is called Brahmana;\nbecause he walks quietly, therefore he is called Samana; because he\nhas sent away his own impurities, therefore he is called Pravragita\n(Pabbagita, a pilgrim).\n\n389. No one should attack a Brahmana, but no Brahmana (if attacked)\nshould let himself fly at his aggressor! Woe to him who strikes a\nBrahmana, more woe to him who flies at his aggressor!\n\n390. It advantages a Brahmana not a little if he holds his mind back\nfrom the pleasures of life; when all wish to injure has vanished, pain\nwill cease.\n\n391. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who does not offend by body, word, or\nthought, and is controlled on these three points.\n\n392. After a man has once understood the law as taught by the\nWell-awakened (Buddha), let him worship it carefully, as the Brahmana\nworships the sacrificial fire.\n\n393. A man does not become a Brahmana by his platted hair, by his\nfamily, or by birth; in whom there is truth and righteousness, he is\nblessed, he is a Brahmana.\n\n394. What is the use of platted hair, O fool! what of the raiment of\ngoat-skins? Within thee there is ravening, but the outside thou makest\nclean.\n\n395. The man who wears dirty raiments, who is emaciated and covered with\nveins, who lives alone in the forest, and meditates, him I call indeed a\nBrahmana.\n\n396. I do not call a man a Brahmana because of his origin or of his\nmother. He is indeed arrogant, and he is wealthy: but the poor, who is\nfree from all attachments, him I call indeed a Brahmana.\n\n397. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who has cut all fetters, who never\ntrembles, is independent and unshackled.\n\n398. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who has cut the strap and the thong,\nthe chain with all that pertains to it, who has burst the bar, and is\nawakened.\n\n399. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who, though he has committed no\noffence, endures reproach, bonds, and stripes, who has endurance for his\nforce, and strength for his army.\n\n400. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who is free from anger, dutiful,\nvirtuous, without appetite, who is subdued, and has received his last\nbody.\n\n401. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who does not cling to pleasures, like\nwater on a lotus leaf, like a mustard seed on the point of a needle.\n\n402. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who, even here, knows the end of his\nsuffering, has put down his burden, and is unshackled.\n\n403. Him I call indeed a Brahmana whose knowledge is deep, who possesses\nwisdom, who knows the right way and the wrong, and has attained the\nhighest end.\n\n404. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who keeps aloof both from laymen and\nfrom mendicants, who frequents no houses, and has but few desires.\n\n405. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who finds no fault with other beings,\nwhether feeble or strong, and does not kill nor cause slaughter.\n\n406. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who is tolerant with the intolerant,\nmild with fault-finders, and free from passion among the passionate.\n\n407. Him I call indeed a Brahmana from whom anger and hatred, pride and\nenvy have dropt like a mustard seed from the point of a needle.\n\n408. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who utters true speech, instructive\nand free from harshness, so that he offend no one.\n\n409. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who takes nothing in the world that is\nnot given him, be it long or short, small or large, good or bad.\n\n410. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who fosters no desires for this world\nor for the next, has no inclinations, and is unshackled.\n\n411. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who has no interests, and when he has\nunderstood (the truth), does not say How, how? and who has reached the\ndepth of the Immortal.\n\n412. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who in this world is above good and\nevil, above the bondage of both, free from grief from sin, and from\nimpurity.\n\n413. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who is bright like the moon, pure,\nserene, undisturbed, and in whom all gaiety is extinct.\n\n414. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who has traversed this miry road, the\nimpassable world and its vanity, who has gone through, and reached\nthe other shore, is thoughtful, guileless, free from doubts, free from\nattachment, and content.\n\n415. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who in this world, leaving all\ndesires, travels about without a home, and in whom all concupiscence is\nextinct.\n\n416. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who, leaving all longings, travels\nabout without a home, and in whom all covetousness is extinct.\n\n417. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who, after leaving all bondage to men,\nhas risen above all bondage to the gods, and is free from all and every\nbondage.\n\n418. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who has left what gives pleasure and\nwhat gives pain, who is cold, and free from all germs (of renewed life),\nthe hero who has conquered all the worlds.\n\n419. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who knows the destruction and the\nreturn of beings everywhere, who is free from bondage, welfaring\n(Sugata), and awakened (Buddha).\n\n420. Him I call indeed a Brahmana whose path the gods do not know, nor\nspirits (Gandharvas), nor men, whose passions are extinct, and who is an\nArhat (venerable).\n\n421. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who calls nothing his own, whether it\nbe before, behind, or between, who is poor, and free from the love of\nthe world.\n\n422. Him I call indeed a Brahmana, the manly, the noble, the hero,\nthe great sage, the conqueror, the impassible, the accomplished, the\nawakened.\n\n423. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who knows his former abodes, who sees\nheaven and hell, has reached the end of births, is perfect in knowledge,\na sage, and whose perfections are all perfect."
