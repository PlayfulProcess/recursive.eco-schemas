# Proctor's Skeptical Astrology

A critical examination of astrology based on Richard A. Proctor's *Myths and Marvels of Astronomy* (1896). This schema presents traditional astrological concepts alongside their skeptical critiques—a grammar for understanding astrology's claims while recognizing its logical failures.

## About the Author

Richard A. Proctor (1837-1888) was a distinguished English astronomer and science writer. Unlike mere debunkers, Proctor approached astrology with scholarly curiosity, documenting its claims in detail while systematically exposing its flaws. His wit makes the critique memorable:

> "It would appear likely, by the way, that astrology was a purely masculine science." (On feminine signs being consistently marked "unfortunate")

## Schema Structure

**Total Items**: 49

### L1 - Traditional Concepts with Critique (32 items)

| Type | Count | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Planets | 8 | Including Uranus, the embarrassing modern addition |
| Signs | 12 | With Proctor's sardonic physical descriptions |
| Houses | 12 | The "idle figments" even Bacon rejected |

### L2 - Skeptical Arguments & Legacies (12 items)

| Type | Count | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Skeptical Arguments | 8 | From Cicero's distance argument to Proctor's contemporary examples |
| Cultural Legacies | 3 | Week origin, Sabbath, Bacon's "Astrologia Sana" |
| Philosophical Critique | 1 | Whewell's mysticism analysis |

### L3 - Meta-Categories (5 items)

- **l3-planets**: The seven + Uranus
- **l3-signs**: The zodiac with gender bias exposed
- **l3-houses**: The "darling inventions" of astrology
- **l3-skeptical-arguments**: Accumulated rational objections
- **l3-legacies**: What astrology left behind in language and culture

## Key Skeptical Arguments

### 1. The Argument from Distance (Cicero)
> "What contagion can reach us from the planets, whose distance is almost infinite?"

### 2. The Argument from Twins
Jacob and Esau, born at the same moment, had entirely different fates—directly contradicting astrological principles.

### 3. The Copernican Challenge
> "The first real shock sustained by astrology came from the arguments of Copernicus. So long as the earth was regarded as the centre... it was hopeless to shake men's faith."

### 4. Failed Predictions
The Chaldaeans predicted Caesar, Crassus, and Pompey would die "in a full old age, in their own houses, in peace and honour"—all three died violently.

### 5. The Prince of Wales Farce
Zadkiel predicted contradictory traits (avaricious AND generous, prudent AND rash, modest AND lofty) and specific events (injury by horse, May 1870) that never occurred.

### 6. The Uranus Problem
> "It is unfortunate for astrology that nothing was ever observed which seemed to suggest an unknown planet. Astrologers tell us now that Uranus is a very potent planet; yet the old astrologers got on very well without him."

## Proctor's Wit

On George IV as "proof" of Venus's benevolence:
> "That her influence is good is shown (in the opinion of Raphael, writing in 1828) by the character of George IV., 'our present beloved monarch'—'a most illustrious proof of the celestial science.'"

(George IV was notorious for debauchery and excess.)

On Pisces natives being "round-shouldered (like fish)":
> A delightful example of astrologers finding resemblances where none exist.

On feminine signs being unfortunate:
> "It is feminine, and therefore, naturally, unfortunate."

## The Enduring Legacy

Despite astrology's intellectual bankruptcy, it left permanent marks:

**In Language:**
- "In the ascendant" (from the Ascendant House)
- "Jovial" (from Jupiter)
- "Mercurial" (from Mercury)
- "Saturnine" (from Saturn)
- "Martial" (from Mars)

**In the Calendar:**
- The seven-day week derives entirely from astrological hour-assignments
- Saturday, Sunday, Monday directly name their planets
- Tuesday through Friday name Germanic equivalents

## Emergence Pattern

This schema uses the **emergence level system** uniquely:

- **L1 items** present the traditional astrological claims
- **L2 items** emerge as the *critiques* of those claims—skeptical arguments composed from the L1 material they debunk
- **L3 items** organize both the traditional system and its critique

The `composite_of` field in L2 skeptical arguments references the L1 items they critique.

## Usage Notes

This schema serves multiple purposes:

1. **Historical Understanding**: Grasp what astrologers actually claimed
2. **Critical Thinking**: See how rational argument dismantles pseudoscience
3. **Linguistic Archaeology**: Understand astrological terminology in literature
4. **Comparative Study**: Contrast with Ptolemy's earnest Tetrabiblos

## Selected Quote

> "Experience collects her stores in vain, or ceases to collect them, when she can only pour them into the flimsy folds of the lap of Mysticism, who is, in truth, so much absorbed in looking for the treasures which are to fall from the skies, that she heeds little how scantily she obtains, or how loosely she holds, such riches as she might find beside her."
> — Whewell, quoted by Proctor
