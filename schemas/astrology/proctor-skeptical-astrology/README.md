## About the Author

Richard A. Proctor (1837-1888) was a distinguished English astronomer and science writer. He documented astrology's claims in scholarly detail while systematically exposing its logical failures. His wit makes the critique memorable.

## Sample Wit

On George IV as "proof" of Venus's benevolence:
> "'Our present beloved monarch'—'a most illustrious proof of the celestial science.'" (George IV was notorious for debauchery.)

On feminine signs being unfortunate:
> "It is feminine, and therefore, naturally, unfortunate."

On the post-hoc addition of Uranus:
> "Astrologers tell us now that Uranus is a very potent planet; yet the old astrologers seem to have got on very well without him."

## Critical Patterns Exposed

### Gender Bias
Proctor notes that feminine signs are consistently marked "unfortunate" while masculine signs are "fortunate"—revealing astrology's embedded patriarchal assumptions.

### Post-hoc Reasoning
Events are attributed to planetary positions only after they occur. Any major London event gets connected to Gemini; any failed prediction is explained away.

### Contradictory Predictions
The Prince of Wales was predicted to be both "avaricious AND generous," "prudent AND rash," "modest AND lofty"—covering all bases.

## Selected Quote

> "Experience collects her stores in vain, or ceases to collect them, when she can only pour them into the flimsy folds of the lap of Mysticism, who is, in truth, so much absorbed in looking for the treasures which are to fall from the skies, that she heeds little how scantily she obtains, or how loosely she holds, such riches as she might find beside her."
> — Whewell, quoted by Proctor
