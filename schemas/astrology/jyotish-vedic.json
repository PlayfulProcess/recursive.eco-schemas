  "name": "Jyotish: Vedic Astrology",
  "description": "Traditional Hindu astrology (Jyotisha) using the sidereal zodiac. Jyotish means 'science of light' and is one of the six Vedangas (limbs of the Vedas). Unlike Western tropical astrology, Vedic astrology uses the fixed stars as reference points, creating a ~24° difference in sign positions. Central concepts include the Nakshatras (27 lunar mansions), Dashas (planetary periods), and Yogas (planetary combinations). This schema provides interpretations rooted in classical texts like Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra, Jataka Parijata, and Phaladeepika.",
