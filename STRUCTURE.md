## Philosophy

This structure is designed to:

1. **Be Accessible**: Clear organization makes it easy to find and contribute schemas
2. **Nurture Growth**: Separate spaces for different traditions allow each to flourish
3. **Support Commons**: Templates and data are shared resources for the community
4. **Enable Recursion**: The structure can grow and adapt as the community evolves
