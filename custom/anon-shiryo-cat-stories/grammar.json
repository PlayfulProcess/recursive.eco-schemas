Each story teaches a relational grammar: a pattern of how to be with others and with nature. Designed for recursive AI-assisted creation — each story cover acts as a generative seed containing enough context (values, characters, visual references, symbolic roots) for an AI collaborator to generate missing images and text while maintaining the soul of the story.",

When the kitten does something the robot doesn't understand or like, Shiryo's first instinct is to complain — to announce what's wrong. But complaining pushes the kitten away.

        "Grammar": "ANTI-PATTERN: Complaining (announcing what is wrong, positioning yourself as the one affected)\nPATTERN: Asking (making a request, positioning the other as someone who can help)\n\nComplaining says: 'This is wrong and I'm telling you.'\nAsking says: 'I need something — can you help?'\n\nThe shift is from broadcasting pain to inviting connection.",

        "Symbolic_Research": "In many traditions, the act of asking is sacred. Prayer in most cultures is structured as a request, not a complaint. The Japanese concept of amaeru (甘える) — to presume upon and depend on another's goodwill — recognizes that healthy dependence is a form of trust, not weakness. In nonviolent communication (Rosenberg), the distinction between a complaint ('You never listen') and a request ('Would you be willing to hear me?') is foundational. For children, this is the first grammar of social agency: learning that how you frame a need changes whether it gets met.",

In Japanese culture, itadakimasu (いただきます) before eating means 'I humbly receive' — it's gratitude directed at the food, the farmer, the animal, the earth. Even in Western traditions, 'grace' before meals is thanks, not congratulations. Nature doesn't need your score. It needs your attention and care. For children: the difference between 'good job!'

        "Design_Philosophy": "These stories are not about manners. They are about relational grammars — the deep patterns that shape how we connect.\n\nThe robot is the perfect protagonist because it has no social conditioning. It tries the 'logical' approach first (complain, praise, fix, judge) and slowly discovers the relational approach (ask, thank, tend, notice).\n\nThe cat is the perfect teacher because nature doesn't negotiate. A cat will not respond to commands, complaints, or applause. A cat responds to genuine presence.\n\nThe parent (Anon) is not the authority. Anon models the grammar by living it — asking instead of telling, thanking instead of praising — but the final line always reveals: Anon is learning too.\n\nThis is the recursive structure: the child learns from the cat, the parent learns from watching the child learn. The reader learns from all three.",
        "Symbolic_Roots": "Japanese: 思慮 (shiryo, thoughtfulness), 甘える (amaeru, healthy dependence), いただきます (itadakimasu, 'I humbly receive')\nHaudenosaunee: The Thanksgiving Address — thanking each element of the natural world\nNonviolent Communication (Rosenberg): requests vs. demands, observations vs. evaluations\nIndigenous traditions: responding to nature with gratitude and tending, not praise\nMonastery traditions: 'grace' as thanks, not congratulations\n\nThese are not decorative references — they are the root system under each simple story.",
        "Generation_Guidance": "When generating new stories, images, or expanding existing ones, maintain:\n\n1. VISUAL CONSISTENCY — same characters, same palette, same style across all pages and stories\n2. TONAL CONSISTENCY — gentle, unhurried, honest. Never preach. Humor from literalness meeting wildness\n3. STRUCTURAL CONSISTENCY — each story has an anti-pattern → pattern arc, 10 pages, same closing line\n4. DEPTH WITHOUT WEIGHT — the symbolic research informs but doesn't appear in the story text. Kids feel it; they don't need to read it\n5. RECURSIVE ENDING — every story ends with Anon learning too. This is non-negotiable."

A parent figure (Anon) is partially visible in the background — a warm presence, not the focus. Scattered throughout are small totems from the stories: a cup on the table (from Story 1), a small leaf on the floor and a tiny tomato plant (from Story 2), a watering can. Golden light connects everything. The feeling is: home, learning, alive, imperfect, loved. Leave space at the top for the series title.
