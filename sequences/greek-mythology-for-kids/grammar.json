Many versions of the myth relate that she incurred the god's wrath by refusing him sex, after promising herself to him in exchange for the power of prophecy.\n\nATHENA AND POSEIDON\nAthena and Poseidon vied for control of Athens and its surrounding territory, Attica. The contest took place on the Acropolis. Poseidon struck the rock with his trident and produced a salt spring or a horse. Athena brought forth an olive tree from the ground by the touch of her spear and she was proclaimed the victor.\n\nSubscribe to our Cartoon For Kids Channel: \nhttps://bit.ly/1BmTOqY\n\n#greekstories #greekgods #greekmythology #ancientgreekgods"

Also, Zeus sent Pandora with a little box, with a big lock on it (Actually in the earliest versions of this story it is a sealed pottery vase)\n\nPERSEPHONE\nThe story of Persephone, the sweet daughter of goddess Demeter who was kidnapped by Hades and later became the Queen of the Underworld, is known all over the world. It is actually the way of the ancient Greeks to explain the change of the seasons, the eternal cycle of the Nature's death and rebirth.\n\nSubscribe to our Cartoon For Kids Channel:\nhttps://bit.ly/1BmTOqY\n\n#greekmyth #medusa #persephone #anckentgreece #greekgoddesses #greekmythology"

Post-Classical Jewish traditions stressed his status as the representative of paganism, in contrast to David, the champion of the God of Israel. Christian tradition sees David's battle with Goliath the victory of God's king over the enemies of God's helpless people as a prefiguring of Jesus' victory over sin on the cross and the Church's victory over Satan.\n\nThe phrase \"David and Goliath\" (or \"David versus Goliath\") has taken on a more popular meaning, denoting an underdog situation, a contest where a smaller, weaker opponent faces a much bigger, stronger adversary.\n\nSubscribe to our Cartoons for Kids Channel:\nhttps://goo.gl/uPjXWn\n\n#story #stories #bible #biblestories #biblestory #christian #jesuschrist #david&goliath #adamandeve - The Bible Story Of David And Goliath for Kids - ( Children Christian Bible Cartoon Movie )"

Zeus ruled the entire universe - no one was mightier than the mighty Zeus.  Zeus was not afraid of anything except possibly his wife, the horrible Hera.\n\nMagically, Zeus was the only god who could throw lightning bolts. He could shape shift, and look like anybody. He could throw his voice and sound like anybody.\n\n As king, he had powers that came from being king of all the gods. These were powers of government. He could give other gods titles and jobs. He could take those titles and jobs away. He could direct other gods, like any leader. His was an elected position. There were 12 gods on the council. They could have voted someone else king. But they never did. And Zeus never retired.\n\nThere are many myths, of course, about the king of all the Greek gods.\n\nSubscribe to our Cartoon For Kids Channel:\nhttps://bit.ly/1BmTOqY\n\n#greekmyth #medusa #zeus #anckentgreece #greekgoddesses #greekmythology"
