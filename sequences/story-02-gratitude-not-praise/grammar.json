Anon at the window, inside or outside, watching. The recursive pattern: parent learns from watching robot learn from the cat. The series signature line: 'because they were learning too.' Wide, warm, golden. Home."

By the sunny window with plants on the sill, an orange kitten is curled up against a copper robot's warm side — small, trusting, perfectly at peace. The robot is still and tender, eye-light at its warmest glow. Near them on the floor: a freshly filled water bowl and a small leaf. In the background, at the window or leaning on the counter, Anon watches — partially visible, a soft smile, hands resting. Golden afternoon light fills the entire scene. This mirrors Story 1's ending but deeper — they've all grown. This is home. This is learning. Warm watercolor style, muted earth tones with rich golden light.
