## Email/Post Draft

**Subject:** Looking for collaborators: Open source historical tarot archive

Hi everyone,

I've started an open-source project to create structured, scholarly tarot deck data that anyone can use, fork, and build upon. I've begun with the Sola Busca, adding etymology, historical figures (drawing from Orosius connections discussed here), and source citations.

**The problem:** I'm a MSW student, work full-time, and I'm a mother. I love tarot and I love this history, but I also love other things—and I simply can't do this cataloging work alone. The depth of knowledge in this forum is extraordinary, and I think together we could build something lasting.

**What I'm proposing:**
- A public GitHub repo (CC-BY-SA licensed) where anyone can contribute deck data
- Structured JSON format for historical accuracy + machine readability
- My app will auto-update from the main branch—contributors see their work live
- No images stored (links to Wikimedia Commons)—just scholarly text data

**What I need:**
- Corrections to my Sola Busca work
- Contributors who want to add other historical decks
- Guidance on sources and methodology

**Repo:** [INSERT GITHUB LINK]

**Example card (Carbone XII):** [INSERT EXAMPLE OR SCREENSHOT]

I don't want to "own" this—I want to steward it. Would anyone be interested?

## Note on Private App Repository

I want to be transparent: while the deck data repo is fully open source, my main application code is in a private repository. Here's why:

1. **Ethical concerns:** I've thought carefully about this. A tool that helps people reflect through tarot could easily be turned into something extractive—exploiting people's faith, harvesting personal spiritual data, or manipulating vulnerable users. By keeping the app code private, I make it harder for bad actors to quickly clone and weaponize it.

2. **Code quality:** I'm being honest—I vibe coded the whole thing. It works, but it's not documented, not clean, and I don't have time to make it presentable. I'd be embarrassed to show it publicly in its current state.

3. **The data is the gift:** The real scholarly value is in the deck data itself—the research, etymology, historical connections. That's what I'm opening up. The app is just a vessel.

If anyone has concerns about this approach, I'm happy to discuss. My goal is to protect both the community and any future users while still contributing something meaningful to tarot scholarship.

## TODO before sending:
- [ ] Create a clean example showing one fully enriched card
- [ ] Set up public GitHub repo with clear README and contribution guidelines
- [ ] Lurk in the forum first—read recent discussions, understand the culture
- [ ] Maybe comment helpfully on a thread before making this ask
- [ ] Prepare for questions about the app itself
- [ ] Consider: should I share a demo/screenshots of the app?

## Talking points to develop:
- "Steward, not owner" framing
- CC-BY-SA means their contributions stay open forever
- JSON format = future-proof, works with any tool
- Auto-update from main branch = immediate impact
- No vendor lock-in—data portable to ChatGPT, Claude, any AI, any app
